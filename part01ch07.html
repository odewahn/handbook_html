      Consumers have a wide variety of food choices available.
      You want food that is safe, nutritious, and won’t break
      your budget, but it’s important to remember that making
      healthier choices can help you feel your best and stay
      strong. You can also reduce the risk for many diseases,
      including heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes.

      <p>
        To help you make healthy food choices, the federal
        government posts dietary guidelines at <a href="http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines">www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines</a>. 
        Federal regulations also require many
        foods to identify fat content, fiber, and nutrients on their
        labels. For more information about food labels, visit <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/NFLPM">www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/NFLPM</a>.

        Food safety in the home revolves around three main
        functions: food storage, food handling, and cooking. By

        cooking, and chilling, you can prevent most food-borne
        illness in the home. The website <a href="http://www.foodsafety.gov">www.foodsafety.gov</a>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35837392"><h1>Saving Money On Groceries</h1>
      
      <p>
        It can be a challenge to make healthy food choices and
        stay within your food budget. Here are some tips to help
        you get the most from your grocery budget:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            Take an inventory of the food you already have in your
            home. Plan your meals for the week, keeping in mind
            what you already have.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Make a shopping list and stick to it.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Compare unit prices (cost per ounce or pound) to get
            the best deal.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Buy the generic store brand versions of foods.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Take advantage of store loyalty savings programs
            as well as clipping coupons and online discounts.
            Remember that stores retain your purchase habits and
            use them for marketing purposes. See Protecting Your
            Privacy (p. 38) for more information.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Only take advantage of the deal if you know you will eat
            the discounted item. It’s not a deal if the food goes to
            waste.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Shop the perimeter of the store for nutrient-dense
            foods. Processed and packaged foods tend to be more
            expensive.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Visit your local farmer’s market to find fresh produce.
            Arrive early to get the best selection or late to get the
            best deals. Fresh food spoils quickly, so don’t buy more
            than you can eat or freeze. Find your local farmers
            market at <a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets">search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets</a>.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Shop for foods that are in season. When the supply is
            plentiful, the prices tend to be lower.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Some stores offer discounts to customers for bringing 
            their own bags.
          </p>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35837556"><h1>Organic Foods</h1>
      
    <p>
      Buying organic food is a way to eat in a healthy manner and
      protect the environment. These foods are grown and processed
      according to USDA regulations and follow specific rules concerning
      pest control, raising animals, and the use of additives. Keep in
      mind that organic and natural foods tend to be more expensive than
      conventionally grown foods, and that the USDA does not claim that
      organic food is safer or more nutritious than other foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure a product is certified organic, look for the USDA
      organic seal. You can also tell whether produce was grown
      organically by checking the price look up code (PLU); if the first
      number starts with a 4, then the food was grown conventionally, if
      it starts with a 9, it was grown organically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other common labels that help you choose certain types of food 
      products include:
     </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Free-Range or
      Cage-Free</strong>. The flock was provided shelter in a
      building, room, or area with unlimited access to food, fresh
      water, and the outdoors during its production cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Natural</strong>. As required by USDA,
      meat, poultry, and egg products labeled as “natural” must be
      minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grass-Fed</strong>. Grass-fed animals
      receive a majority of their nutrients from grass throughout their
      life, while organic animals’ pasture diet may be supplemented with
      grain.
    </p>
