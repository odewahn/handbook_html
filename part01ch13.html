    <p>
      Identity thieves steal your personal information to commit fraud.
      They can damage your credit status and cost you time and money to
      restore your good name. To reduce your risk of becoming a victim,
      follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t carry your Social Security
          card</strong> in your wallet or write your number on your
          checks. Only give out your SSN when absolutely necessary.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Protect your PIN.</strong> Never
          write a PIN on a credit/debit card or on a slip of paper kept
          in your wallet.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Watch out for “shoulder
          surfers.”</strong> Use your free hand to shield the keypad
          when typing your passwords on computers and at ATMs.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Collect mail promptly.</strong> Ask
          the post office to put your mail on hold when you are away
          from home for more than a day or two.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Pay attention to your billing
          cycles.</strong> If bills or financial statements are late,
          contact the sender.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep your receipts.</strong> Ask for
          carbons and incorrect charge slips as well. Promptly compare
          receipts with account statements. Watch for unauthorized
          transactions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Tear up or shred</strong> unwanted
          receipts, credit offers, account statements, expired cards,
          etc., to prevent “dumpster divers” (see p. 7) from getting
          your personal information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Store personal information in a safe
          place</strong> at home and at work. Don’t leave it lying
          around.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t respond to unsolicited
          requests</strong> for personal information in the mail, over
          the phone, or online.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Install firewalls</strong> and
          virus-detection software on your home computer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create complex
          passwords</strong> that identity thieves cannot guess easily.
          For tips on creating secure passwords, see p. 40.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check your credit report once a
          year.</strong> Check it more frequently if you suspect
          someone has gained access to your account information. See
          Free Credit Reports (p. 12).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35841681"><h1>Reporting Identity Theft</h1>
      
    <p>
      If you suspect or become a victim of identity theft, follow these
      steps:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Report it to your financial
          institution.</strong> Call the phone number on your account
          statement or on the back of your credit or debit card.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Report the fraud to your local
          police.</strong> Keep a copy of the police report, which
          will make it easier to prove your case to creditors and
          retailers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Contact the credit reporting
          bureaus</strong> (p. 13) and ask them to flag your account
          with a fraud alert, which asks merchants not to grant new
          credit without your approval.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      If your identity has been stolen, you can use an ID Theft
      affidavit to report the theft to most of the parties involved. All
      three credit bureaus and many major creditors accept the
      affidavit. Request a copy of the document by calling toll-free
      1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338) or visit
      <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft">www.ftc.gov/idtheft</a>. You
      can also use this website to file a complaint with the FTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FTC also publishes a series of publications about the
      importance of personal information privacy. To download copies, go
      to <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a> or request free
      copies of brochures by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357).

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35841747"><h5>If Your Wallet Is Stolen</h5>
      
    <p>
      Your wallet contains some of your most important personal items,
      from hard-earned money to credit cards and driver’s license. For
      an identity thief, your wallet offers a treasure trove of personal
      information. If your wallet is lost or stolen:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          File a report with the police immediately.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cancel your credit and debit cards and request new cards 
          and account numbers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Report the missing cards to the major credit reporting
          agencies.

      Today, it’s quick and easy to get a credit card approved, transfer
      money from one account to another, renew your driver’s license,
      fill a prescription from your doctor at your local pharmacy, use
      store loyalty cards, and purchase products online. But you pay for
      this convenience by providing more opportunities for your personal
      information to be changed, stolen, or reported inaccurately.
      Companies can also use the information you have shared to direct
      their future marketing efforts or can sell the information to
      other companies.

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35841816"><h5>Child ID Theft</h5>
      
    <p>
      Children are especially vulnerable to identity theft. The 
      danger is that child ID theft goes unnoticed for years,
      until the child becomes an adult and tries to apply for credit
      or to college. Scam artists use the stolen ID to get
      credit, jobs, medical care, and more. To protect your 
      child’s future, shred all documents with their personal 
      information. Also check your child’s credit report (if there 
      is a credit report, this is a clue that theft has occurred). 
      For more information contact the FTC (p. 107).

        <p>
          To help protect your privacy, follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Look for privacy statements on websites, sales materials, and
          forms you fill out. If a website claims to follow a set of
          established voluntary standards, read the standards. Don’t
          assume it provides the level of privacy you want.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask how your personal information will be stored and used.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Only provide the purchase date, model/serial numbers, and your
          contact information on warranty registration forms.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Discuss privacy with others in your home. Everyone, even
          children, should understand what information is not
          appropriate to share on the phone, while using a computer, and
          in other situations.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Check with your state or local consumer agency (p. 112) to find
      out whether any state laws help protect your privacy. Some
      companies and industry groups have also adopted voluntary policies
      that address privacy concerns.

      <section data-type="sect1" id="id35841879"><h1>Financial Privacy</h1>
        
    <p>
      The FDIC (p. 106) and other federal regulators require banks,
      insurance companies, brokerage firms, and certain businesses that
      share financial information to inform you of their privacy
      policies. They must give you this information when you open an
      account and at least once every year. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          The kinds of information being collected
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How the confidentiality and security of this information will
          be protected
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What types of businesses may be provided this information
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      If a business is going to share the information with
      anyone outside its corporate family, it must also give you the
      chance to “opt out” or say no to information sharing. Even if you
      don’t opt out, your account numbers may not be shared with third
      parties for marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot prevent certain types of information from being shared,
      including information needed to conduct normal business or protect 
      against fraud, or information that is
      already publicly available. Also, a bank can share your
      information with a partner company to market products.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35841927"><h5>Tax ID Theft</h5>
      
    <p>
      Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information
      such as your name, Social Security number (SSN), or other
      identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud
      or other crimes. Usually, an identity thief uses a legitimate
      taxpayer’s identity to file a tax return fraudulently and claim 
      a refund early in the filing season.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe someone has used your SSN fraudulently, contact the 
      IRS immediately at 1-800-908-4490. You will need to fill out the 
      IRS Identity Theft Affidavit, Form 14039. For more information, visit 
      <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft">www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft</a>.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Your credit information has additional privacy protections under
      the FCRA. Only people with a legitimate business need can get a
      copy of your report. An employer can only get your report with
      your written consent. For more information on your rights under
      this federal law, and to find out how you can get a copy of your
      credit reports, see Credit Reports and Scores on page 13.

      <section data-type="sect1" id="id35841967"><h1>Medical Privacy</h1>
        
    <p>
      Personal information you give to your doctor is shared with
      insurance companies, pharmacies, researchers, and employers based
      on specific regulations. The privacy of your health records is
      protected by federal law, specifically under the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA. HIPAA:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Defines your rights over your health information
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Sets rules and limits on who is allowed to receive 
          and/or see your health information
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35841994"><h5>Create Secure Passwords</h5>
      
    <p>
      The number of passwords you need daily can be overwhelming. It is
      tempting to use the same password across several sites; however to
      get the most protection available, you should use different
      passwords on each site and change your passwords periodically. The
      goal for creating passwords is to strike a balance between being
      something that is easy to remember and unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some general tips for creating a secure password include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
          special characters.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The longer the password, the better it is.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t use your name, birthday, license plate, favorite sports
          teams, or other facts that are easily guessed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Create a password based on a phrase. For example, “A stitch in
          time saves nine,” can be translated into the password
          “Ast!Ts9”, where each character represents a word in the
          phrase.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you must use the same password on several websites, add a
          prefix or suffix. For example, use “Ast!Ts9:4bnk” for your
          bank account and “Eml: Ast!Ts9” for your email account.
        </p>

      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
      Office for Civil Rights
      (<a href="http://www.dhhs.gov/ocr"/> or 1-800368-1019) is an excellent
      resource for complete details and advice about the HIPAA ruling.

      consumers, providers, and advocates, along with fact sheets and
      other educational materials.

      You can request a copy of your medical records from the provider
      or from the hospital where medical services were provided. You
      will probably be charged a fee to cover retrieving and mailing
      copies to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe that a person, agency, or organization covered
      under the HIPAA Privacy Rule violated your health information
      privacy rights or committed another violation of the Privacy Rule,
      you may be able to file a written complaint with the Department of
      Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (p. 98).

    <p>
      In addition to following the general advice on protecting your
      privacy, make sure you only use websites with acceptable privacy
      policies.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Look for a privacy policy statement or seal that indicates the
          site abides by privacy standards. Take the time to read how
          your privacy is protected.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Look for signals that you are using a secure web page. A
          secure site encrypts or scrambles personal information so it
          cannot be intercepted easily. Signals include a screen notice
          that says you are on a secure site, a closed padlock or
          unbroken key in the bottom corner of your screen, or the first
          letters of the Internet address you are viewing change from
          “http” to “https.”
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Another threat to your privacy is spyware, software that is
      secretly installed when you download screensavers, games, music,
      and other applications. Spyware sends information about your
      online activities to a third party, usually to target you with
      pop-up ads. Browsers like Internet Explorer and Firefox, and
      search engines like Google and Bing, enable you to block pop-ups.
      You can also install anti-spyware software to stop this threat to
      your privacy. For more information, see Internet on page 41.
