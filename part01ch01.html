    <p>
      To avoid problems and make better decisions, use this checklist
      BEFORE you make a purchase:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Decide in advance exactly what you want and what you can
          afford.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do your research. Ask family, friends, and others you trust
          for advice based on their experience. Gather information about
          the seller and the item or service you are purchasing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Review product test results and other information from
          consumer experts. See Key Information Resources (p. 59) or
          check the <em>Handbook</em> index (p. 147) for
          specific information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get advice and price quotes from several sellers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure the seller has all appropriate licenses. Doctors,
          lawyers, contractors, and other service providers must
          register with a state or local licensing agency.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
<aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35832555"><h5>Drip Pricing</h5>
  
  <p>
    Have you ever planned to make a purchase, only to find out that
    there are additional, sometimes mandatory, fees that weren’t
    included in the advertised price? The total cost is not revealed
    until the end of the purchasing process. If so, you have been the
    victim of drip pricing. This practice makes it difficult for
    consumers to determine the full cost and compare similar options,
    when all the fees aren’t disclosed up front. You can protect
    yourself by reading the policies before completing the sale and
    asking questions of sales personnel. Also, if you have charged your
    purchase on your credit card, you may be able to dispute the extra
    fees if they are more than you had agreed to with the seller.
  </p>
</aside>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        Check out a company’s complaint record with your local consumer
        affairs office (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67).
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Get a written copy of guarantees and warranties.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Get the seller’s refund, return, and cancellation policies.

<aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35832596"><h5>Quick Tips for Avoiding Fraud</h5>
  
  <p>
    There are many varieties of consumer fraud, but the most common ones
    are variations of fake check scams, credit repair, free trip offers,
    and sweepstakes. Here are some tips to help you avoid being a
    victim:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Don’t give out personal
        information</strong>. Be suspicious of anyone you don’t know
        who asks for your Social Security number, birthdate, credit card
        number, bank account number, password, or other personal data.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Don’t be intimidated</strong>. Be
        suspicious of calls or e-mails that want you to provide or
        verify personal information immediately. Answer that you’re not
        interested and hang up or don’t reply to the e-mail.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Monitor your accounts</strong>. Review
        bank and credit card statements carefully, and report
        unauthorized transactions to your financial institution
        immediately.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a shredder.</strong> Tear or shred
        credit offers, bank statements, insurance forms, and other
        papers with personal information.
      </p>
    </li></ul>
</aside>
 <ul><li>
     <p>
     Ask whom to contact if you have a question or problem.
   </p>
   </li><li>
  <p>
    Read and understand any contract or legal document you are asked to
    sign. Make sure there are no blank spaces. Insist that any extras
    you are promised be put in writing.
  </p>
  </li><li>
      <p>
        Consider paying by credit card. If you have a problem, you can
        dispute a charge made on your credit card (p. 13).
      </p>
  </li><li>
   <p>
    Don’t buy on impulse or under pressure; this includes donating to
    charity.
  </p>
  </li></ul>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="service_contracts_and_extended_warranties"><h1>Service Contracts And Extended Warranties</h1>
    
    <p>
      Service contracts or “extended warranties” can add hundreds of
      dollars to your purchase price, but they are rarely worth the
      cost. Some duplicate warranty coverage you get automatically from
      a manufacturer or dealer. Ask these questions before you agree to
      one of these contracts:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Does the dealer, the manufacturer, or an independent company
          back the service contract?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How are claims handled? Who will do the work, and where will
          it be done?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator
          goes out of business?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you need prior authorization for repair work?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are there any situations when coverage can be denied? You may
          not have protection from common wear and tear, or if you fail
          to follow recommendations for routine maintenance.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="product_safety_recalls"><h1>Product Safety Recalls</h1>
    
    <p>
      Before you buy a used vehicle or other second-hand product, check
      to be sure that it hasn’t been recalled for safety reasons. Some
      recalls ban the sale of an item, while others ask consumers to
      return the item for replacement or repair. Sometimes, a seller
      will provide a part that reduces the danger of using the product.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re buying a product for a child, be especially careful.
      Each year, there are approximately 100 recalls of children’s
      products such as toys, clothing, cribs, and costume jewelry. Visit
      the websites in the “Check Here for Recalls” box to find the
      latest safety recalls. You can also sign up for free e-mail
      notifications at

    <section data-type="sect1" id="identifying_and_stopping_fraud"><h1>Identifying And Stopping Fraud</h1>
    
    <p>
      Look for these warning signs to avoid fraud:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          You are asked for your bank account or credit card number.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Someone you don’t know offers you the chance to receive a
          credit card, loan, prize, lottery, or other valuable item, but
          asks you for personal data to claim it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The solicitation looks like a government document and suggests
          that contest winnings or unclaimed assets are yours for a
          small fee. (The government doesn’t solicit money from
          citizens.)
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Someone you don’t know asks you to send money or money orders
          to claim a prize, lottery, credit card, loan, or other
          valuable offer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          An unknown caller claiming to be a lawyer or in law
          enforcement offers to help you get your money back (for a
          fee).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The deal is only good “for today” or a short time.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A “repair person” suddenly finds a dangerous defect in your
          car or home.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          You are given little or no time to read a contract.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A sale item is suddenly unavailable, but a “much better item”
          is available for slightly more money.
        </p>

        <p>

      Late delivery, shipment of wrong or damaged items, and hidden
      costs are common complaints when consumers shop from home. To
      avoid problems and resolve them more easily, follow the advice in

      general tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>

          <strong>Be wary of post office

        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Know the total price.</strong> Make
          sure it includes all charges, shipping, handling, insurance,
          and taxes. Coupons and other discounts should be deducted properly.

  <section data-type="sect2" id="id35833013"><h2>Your Rights</h2>
    
  <p>
    When you order something by mail, phone, or online, the Federal
    Trade Commission (FTC) requires the company to:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        Ship the merchandise within the time promised, or if no specific
        delivery time was stated, within 30 days of receiving your
        order.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Notify you if the shipment cannot be made on time and give you
        the option of waiting longer or getting a refund.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Cancel your order and return your payment if the new shipping
        date cannot be met, unless you agree to another delay.
      </p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>
    If you cancel your order, your money must be refunded within seven
    days (or your account must be credited within one billing cycle if
    you charged the order). The company can’t substitute a store credit.
    If you applied for a charge account with the merchant at the same
    time that you placed your order, the company has an extra 20 days to
    ship the merchandise to allow time for processing your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    These FTC rules only apply to the first shipment of magazine
    subscriptions or other merchandise you receive repeatedly. Orders
    for services (for example, photo finishing), sale of seeds and
    growing plants, and collect-on-delivery (C.O.D.) orders, are covered by a different FTC
    rule. Your state may also have rules that apply. Report suspected
    violations to your state or local consumer protection agency (p.
    112) and to the FTC (p. 107).
  </p>
<aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35833065"><h5>Online and Group Coupons</h5>
  
  <p>
    In addition to the traditional coupons found in newspapers, coupons
    can be found online. They may be found on manufacturers’,
    companies’, dedicated coupon, or social media websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group coupons are another online saving tool. Local companies offer
    reduced prices for things like spa services, gourmet meals, and
    outdoor adventures through a third-party company; then you pay the
    third-party company to take advantage of the deal. Group coupons
    allow you to try new experiences by reducing the trial cost. Before
    you purchase a group coupon, ask yourself, “Am I really going to use
    this?” If the answer is no, don’t buy it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read the terms and conditions of all coupons for expiration dates or
    use limitations.

  <section data-type="sect2" id="id35833096"><h2>3-Day Cooling-Off Rule</h2>
    
  <p>
    This federal law, which dates back to 1972, protects consumers in
    their homes during door-to-door sales pitches or at sales in
    temporary business locations. According to the FTC, the 3-Day
    Cooling-Off Rule does NOT apply to the purchase of new automobiles
    or items sold online. It only applies when a company is selling
    something that costs $25 or more at a location other than its
    regular place of business.
  </p>
  <p>
    To comply with the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule, a seller must inform
    buyers of their right to cancel the sale and receive a full refund
    within three business days.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be aware that there are situations in which the Cooling-Off Rule
    does not apply:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        You made the purchase entirely by mail, online, or telephone.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        The sale was the result of prior contact you had at the seller’s
        permanent business location.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You signed a document waiving your right to cancel.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Your purchase is not primarily for personal, family, or
        household use.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You were buying real estate, insurance, securities, or a motor
        vehicle.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You can’t return the item in a condition similar to how you
        received it.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You bought arts or crafts at a fair, shopping mall, civic
      </p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>
    center, or school. Remember, if you paid by credit card and are
    having difficulty getting your refund, you may also be able to
    dispute the charge with your credit card company
    under the Fair Credit Billing Act. See Credit Card Billing Disputes
    (p. 13).

  <section data-type="sect2" id="id35833170"><h2>Online shopping</h2>
  
  <p>
    Online shopping websites often offer great deals, variety, and
    convenience. However, consumers need to be careful and make informed
    decisions about their purchases. Some tips for shopping safely
    online:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
  <p>
    Stick to websites that are known or recommended.
  </p>
  </li><li>
  <p>
    Compare prices and deals, including free shipping, extended service
    contracts, or other offers.
  </p>
  </li><li>
  <p>
    Search for online coupons, known as promo codes, which may offer
    discounts or free shipping. Some sites offer promo codes for coupons
    to be used in bricks-and-mortar stores.
  </p>
  </li><li>
      <p>
        Get a complete description of the item and parts included, and
        the price, including shipping, delivery time, warranty
        information, return policy, and complaint procedure.
      </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Before you finalize the order, double check the quantity and total
    price are correct.
  </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Pay with a credit card. Federal law protects you if you need to
    dispute charges, but it doesn’t apply to debit cards, checks, cash,
    money orders, or other forms of payment.
  </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Use a secure browser. Look for an address that starts with “https”
    rather than “http.” Also look for a closed padlock icon, usually in
    the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
  </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Avoid making online purchases on public WiFi hotspots; these may
        not be secure, and your payment information could be stolen over
        the network. See WiFi (p. 41) for more information.
      </p>
    </li><li>

    Print your purchase order with details of the product

  <section data-type="sect2" id="id35833253"><h2>Online Auctions and Sellers</h2>
    
  <p>
    Many people sell items on the Internet through auctions, classified
    ads, news groups, and chat rooms. Review the Internet section (p.
    41) for safe shopping online as well as the general tips on shopping
    from home (p. 3). When participating in an online auction, remember
    to:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        Check how the auction works. Can you cancel a bid? Don’t assume
        that the rules one auction site uses apply to another. Some
        sites offer step-by-step instructions that will take you through
        the bidding process.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Find out what protections you have. Does the site provide free
        insurance or guarantees for items that are not delivered or are
        not what the seller claimed?
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Follow the strategies used in any auction. Learn the value of
        the item before you begin bidding, then establish your top price
        and stick to it.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Read past customers’ ratings to determine if the seller is
        reputable and delivered quality products, as promised.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Only bid on an item if you intend to buy. If you’re the highest
        bidder, you have bought it. Auction companies often bar those
        who back out of a deal from future bidding.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        If the seller can’t accept payment by credit card, use an escrow
        service. A third party holds your money until you get your
        purchase and approve release of your payment to the seller.
        There is a small fee, but the peace of mind is worth it.
