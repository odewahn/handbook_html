      Whether reserving a hotel room, buying plane tickets, or making
      other travel arrangements, these tips will help you get the deal
      you’ve been promised:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan as far ahead as you
          can.</strong> Special deals on hotel rooms and airline seats
          often sell out very quickly.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Be flexible in your travel
          plans.</strong> Hotels usually offer better rates on days
          when they expect fewer guests. Once you get a fare quote from
          an airline, ask if you can save money by leaving a day earlier
          or later, by taking a different flight on the same day, or by
          using a different airport. Changing planes during your trip is sometimes cheaper
          than a nonstop flight.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check out the seller.</strong> Ask
          tour operators and travel agents whether they belong to a
          professional association, then check to see if they are
          members in good standing. Contact your state or local consumer
          protection agency (p. 112) and the Better Business Bureau (p.
          67) to find their complaint history.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Comparison shop.</strong> Determine
          the complete cost of the trip in dollars, including all
          service charges, taxes, processing fees, etc.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Beware of unusually cheap prices and
      freebies.</strong> These could be a scam, and you could end up
      paying more than the cost of a regular package tour. See
      information on Drip Pricing on p. 2.
    </p>
    </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Make sure you understand the terms of
      the deal.</strong> If you hear you’ve won a free vacation, ask
      whether you have to buy something in order to get it. If the
      destination is a beach resort, ask the seller how far the hotel is
      from the beach. Then ask the hotel.
    </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ask about cancellation
          policies.</strong> You may want to look into travel
          insurance for added protection (see 34). The website
          <a href="http://www.insuremytrip.com">www.insuremytrip.com</a>
          offers pricing and policy information on plans from different
          companies and describes the different forms of policies
          available.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Insist on written
          confirmations.</strong> Ask for written proof of
          reservations, rates, and dates.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Pay by credit card.</strong> It’s
          not unusual to make a deposit or even pay in full for travel
          services before the trip. Paying by credit card gives you the
          right to dispute charges for services that were misrepresented
          or never delivered. If a travel agent or service provider says
          you can’t leave for at least two months, be very cautious— the
          deadline for disputing a credit card charge is 60 days, and
          most scam artists know this. (See Credit Card Billing
          Disputes, p. 13).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      In some states, travel sellers must be registered and insured.
      Advance payments for travel must be placed in an escrow account
      until services are provided. Prizes or “free” gifts may also be
      regulated. Contact your state or local consumer protection agency
      (p. 112) to find out about your rights and how to file complaints.
      The American Society of Travel Agents (p. 143) also helps to
      resolve disputes with member agents.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35844270"><h1>Resolving Air Travel Problems</h1>
      
    <p>
      No matter how well you plan, you might encounter these common air
      travel hassles.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35844280"><h2>Delayed and Canceled Flights</h2>
      
    <p>
      Airline delays caused by bad weather, traffic control problems,
      and mechanical repairs are hard to predict. If your flight is
      canceled, most airlines will rebook you on the earliest flight
      possible to your destination, at no additional charge. If you’re
      able to find a flight on another airline, ask the first airline 
      to endorse your ticket to the new
      carrier. This could save you from a fare increase, but there is no
      rule requiring the airline to do this.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35844290"><h5>Airline Fees</h5>
    
    <p>
      Many airlines charge extra fees for checked baggage and some
      charge for carry-ons. Others charge for advance seat assignments,
      meals, unaccompanied minors, and other services. The Department of
      Transportation has ruled that an airline must prominently disclose
      all mandatory taxes and fees on their websites. The airline must
      also refund baggage fees if it loses your baggage. In addition,
      airlines are required to include all government taxes and fees in
      the advertised price. However, air carriers may still charge
      optional fees not included in the standard price. Each airline’s
      fee schedule is different, so check with the airline before you
      head to the airport. For more information, go to
      <a href="airconsumer.dot.gov/subjects.htm">airconsumer.dot.gov/subjects.htm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind—using frequent flyer points doesn’t necessarily mean
      you are exempt from additional fees. When booking a flight using
      frequent flyer points, airlines may still charge you a booking fee
      or pet fee.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for
      delayed passengers; there are no federal requirements. If your
      flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline whether it will pay
      for meals or a phone call. Contrary to what many people believe,
      airlines are not required to do so.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35844321"><h2>Delayed or Damaged Bags</h2>
      
    <p>
      If your bags aren’t on the conveyor belt when you arrive, file a
      report with the airline before you leave the airport:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Insist the airline fill out a form and give you a copy, even
          if personnel say the bag will be on the next flight.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get the name of the person who filled out the form and a phone
          number.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Confirm that the airline will deliver the bag to you without 
          charge when it’s found.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
       Some airlines will give you money
      to purchase a few necessities. If they don’t provide you with
      cash, ask what types of articles are reimbursable and keep all
      receipts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a suitcase arrives damaged, the airline may pay for repairs if
      you file a claim immediately (before you leave the airport). If an
      item can’t be fixed, the airline will negotiate to pay you its
      depreciated value. The same is true for belongings packed inside a
      suitcase. However, airlines may refuse to pay for damage if it was
      caused by your failure to pack something properly rather than by
      the airline’s handling.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35844376"><h2>Lost Bags</h2>
      
    <p>
      If your bag is declared officially lost, you will have to submit a
      second, more detailed form within a time period set by the
      airline. The information on the form is used to estimate the value
      of your lost belongings. Airlines can limit their liability for
      delay, loss, and damage to baggage; however, they must prominently
      display a sign that explains the limit. According to the Office of
      Aviation Consumer Protection and Enforcement
      (<a href="airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/SA_Baggage_Limits.htm"/>),
      the maximum an airline pays on lost bags and their contents is
      limited to $3,300 per passenger on domestic flights, and
      approximately $1,500 per passenger for unchecked baggage on
      international flights. See
      <a href="http://www.thetravelinsider.info/travelaccessories/lostbaggagerights.htm">www.thetravelinsider.info/travelaccessories/lostbaggagerights.htm</a>
      for more information on maximum liability, including special rates
      that change daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the airline’s offer doesn’t cover your loss fully, check your
      homeowners or renters insurance to see whether it covers losses
      away from home. Some credit card companies and travel agencies
      also offer optional or even automatic supplemental baggage
      coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On those trips when you know you’re carrying more than the
      liability limits, you may want to ask about purchasing “excess
      valuation” from the airline when you check in. Of course, there is
      no guarantee the airline will sell you this protection. The
      airline may refuse, especially if the item is valuable or
      breakable.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35844419"><h2>Overbooked Flights</h2>
      
    <p>
      Selling more tickets than there are seats is not illegal. Most
      airlines overbook their flights to compensate for “no-shows.” If
      there are more passengers than seats just before a plane is
      scheduled to depart, you can be “bumped” or left behind against
      your will. Whether you are bumped may depend on when you
      officially checked in for your flight, so check-in early. The U.S.
      Department of Transportation requires airlines to ask people to
      give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation.
      Airlines decide what to offer volunteers, such as money, a free
      trip, food, or lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federal rules protect you if you are “bumped” on most flights
      within the United States and on outbound international flights.
      Passengers who are bumped involuntarily are protected under
      Federal Aviation Administration
      guidelines (<a href="http:www.faa.gov"/>). If you volunteer to be bumped,
      your agreement with the airline is not regulated and will depend
      on negotiating at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The airline must give you a written statement describing your
      rights as well as the airline’s boarding priority rules and
      criteria. If the airline is not able to get you to your final
      destination within two hours of your original arrival time, you
      may be entitled to a maximum of $800 compensation if you are
      delayed (that is, more than two hours for domestic and four hours
      for international) from your original arrival time. The amount
      depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay. To
      receive this payment, you must have a confirmed reservation. You
      must also meet the airline’s deadlines for ticketing and check-in.
      An airline may offer you a free ticket on a future flight in place
      of a check, but you have the right to insist on a check.

      <section data-type="sect2" id="id35844463"><h2>Tarmac Delays</h2>
        
    <p>
      Under new federal rules, U.S. airlines operating domestic flights
      must allow passengers to deplane after a tarmac delay of three
      hours. The only exceptions allowed are for safety or security, or
      if air traffic control advises the pilot otherwise. Carriers are
      also required to provide adequate food and drinking water within
      two hours of being delayed on the tarmac; they must also maintain
      operable lavatories and, if necessary, provide medical attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other protections as well, such as prohibiting airlines
      from scheduling chronically delayed flights. For more information,
      go to
      <a href="http://www.airconsumer.ost.dot.gov">www.airconsumer.ost.dot.gov</a>,

    <p>
      A valid U.S. passport is required to enter and leave most foreign
      countries. The Passport Services Office provides information and
      services to American citizens about how to obtain, replace, or
      change a passport. All American citizens must now have a valid
      U.S. passport to re-enter the country, regardless of what nations
      they have been visiting while traveling. For more information on
      how to get a new passport, visit
      <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/passport">www.travel.state.gov/passport</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acceptance facilities include many federal, state, and probate
      courts; post offices; some public libraries; and a number of
      county and municipal offices. There are also 25 regional passport
      agencies, and one Gateway City Agency, that serve customers who
      are traveling within two weeks (14 days), or who need foreign
      visas for travel. Appointments are required in such cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain a passport for the first time, you need to appear in
      person at one of 7,000 passport acceptance facilities located
      throughout the United States with:

    <p>
      Some travelers have turned to commercial buses as an inexpensive
      option for traveling long distances. Before planning a trip on a
      commercial bus or hired motorcoach, you should research the
      company’s record. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
      (FMCSA) recommends that you contact the company and ask these
      questions:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Do the drivers hold valid Commercial Driver’s Licenses with a
          “passenger” endorsement?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the company comply with the Department of
          Transportation’s drug and alcohol testing requirements for
          drivers?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the company conduct safety inspections of its buses?
        </p>
