      Times have changed for job searching, and numerous
      websites are now available that post private industry
      jobs. Many companies also offer a way to apply online.
      However, these sites and new methods do not replace
      traditional and proven job-hunting approaches such as
      networking, personal contacts, business organizations,
      and interviewing.

      <p>
        If you’re looking for a job, you may come across ads from
        employment agencies or receive calls from recruiters that
        promise wonderful opportunities. While some companies
        honestly want to help you, others are more interested in
        taking your money. Be wary of:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            Promises to get you a job and a guaranteed income
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Up-front fees, even when you are guaranteed a refund if
            you are dissatisfied
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Employment agencies whose ads read like job ads
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Promotions of “previously undisclosed” government
            jobs. All federal jobs are announced to the public at
            <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov">www.usajobs.gov</a>.
          </p>
        </li></ul>
      <p>
        Get a copy of the employment agency contract and review
        it carefully before you pay any money. Check with your
        local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and the Better
        Business Bureau (p. 67) to see whether any complaints
        have been filed about a company.
      </p>
      <p>
      The FTC (p. 107) investigates businesses that fraudulently
      advertise employment openings and guarantee job placement. Contact
      the FTC if you have a complaint.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35836923"><h1>Work-at-Home Companies</h1>
      
    <p>
      Not all work-at-home opportunities deliver on their promises. Some
      classic work-at-home schemes are medical billing, envelope
      stuffing, and assembly or craftwork. Ads for these businesses say,
      “Be part of one of America’s Fastest-Growing Industries. Earn
      thousands of dollars a month from your home!” Legitimate
      work-at-home program sponsors should tell you, in writing, what’s
      involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions
      you might ask a promoter:
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35836935"><h5>Credit Checks: A New Part of the Hiring Process</h5>
      
    <p>
      Are you in the market for a new job? If so, remember that
      potential employers aren’t just reading your résumé; they are also
      reviewing your credit history. Before you apply for any job, get
      your free credit report (see p. 12) for information about your
      credit history, including:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          If you pay your bills on time or late
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How much money you owe
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If someone has sued you
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Before a potential employer can request your credit report or use
      it, the company must notify you and ask your permission. And if a
      company decides not to hire you because of information in your
      credit report, it must tell you (orally or in writing), along with
      information about the credit reporting company and your rights to
      dispute the accuracy of the report. For more information about
      what to know when looking for a job, visit
      <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt080.shtm">www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt080.shtm</a>.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program sponsor to
          list every step of the job.)
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will I be paid a salary, or will my pay be based on
          commission?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          When will I get my first paycheck?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including
          supplies, equipment, and membership fees? What will I get for
          my money?
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      The answers to these questions may help you determine whether a
      work-at-home program is appropriate for your circumstances and
      whether it is legitimate.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35837014"><h2>Multilevel Marketing</h2>
      
    <p>
      Some multilevel marketing plans are legitimate; however, others
      are illegal pyramid schemes. In pyramids, commissions are based on
      the number of distributors recruited. Most of the product sales
      are made to these distributors, not to consumers in general. The
      underlying goods and services, which vary from vitamins to car
      leases, only make the schemes look legitimate. Most people end up
      with nothing to show for their money except the expensive products
      or marketing materials they were pressured to buy for resale.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re thinking about joining what appears to be a legitimate
      multilevel marketing plan, take time to learn about the plan:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          What is the company’s track record?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What products does it sell?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does it sell products to the public at large?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does it have the evidence to back up the claims it makes about
          its product?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Is the product competitively priced?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Is it likely to appeal to a large customer base?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How much does it cost to join the plan?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are monthly minimum sales required to earn a commission?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will you be required to recruit new distributors to earn your
          commission?

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35837092"><h2>Net-Based Business Opportunities</h2>
      
    <p>
      The FTC says that many Internet business opportunities are scams
      that promise more than they can possibly deliver. These companies
      lure would-be entrepreneurs with false promises of big earnings
      for little effort. Some tips for finding a legitimate opportunity:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
    <p>
      Consider the promotion carefully.
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Study the business opportunity’s franchise disclosure document.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Get earnings claims in writing and compare them with the
      experience of previous franchise and business opportunity owners.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Visit previous franchise and business opportunity owners in
      person, preferably at their places of business.
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Check out the company with the local consumer protection
          agency (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to see 
          whether there have been any complaints.
        </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      If the business opportunity involves selling products from
      well-known companies, verify the relationship with the legal
      department of the company whose merchandise you would promote.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Consult an attorney, accountant, or other business advisor before
      you put any money down or sign any papers.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Take your time. Promoters of fraudulent business opportunities are
      likely to use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to buy in. If
      the business opportunity is legitimate, it will still be around
      when you’re ready to decide.

      <p>
        The government’s Unemployment Insurance Program
        provides benefits to eligible workers who become
        unemployed through no fault of their own and who meet
        other eligibility requirements. Each state administers
        its own program under federal guidelines. Eligibility
        requirements, benefit amounts, and length of benefits are
        determined by the states. For more information,
        go to <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/unemployment-insurance/index.htm">www.dol.gov/dol/topic/unemployment-insurance/index.htm</a>.
      </p>
    <p>
      In addition, some states are extending unemployment
      benefits for eligible recipients for up to 13 additional
      weeks. Visit <a href="http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov">workforcesecurity.doleta.gov</a> for the latest
      information regarding your state’s benefit programs.
