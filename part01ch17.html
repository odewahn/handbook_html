      In many states, consumers can choose their telephone and energy
      service provider. Contact your state utility commission (p. 138)
      to find out whether you have a choice. Some commissions will
      provide a list of service providers and advice on making a choice,
      and most state utility commissions will take any complaints you
      have concerning utility sales and service.

    <p>
      When you move into a new home or apartment, you may also be
      required to have the utilities (electricity, gas, water, waste
      removal, and cable) turned on in your name. Your city or county
      government may handle some services, such as water, sewer, and
      garbage collection. If you live in an apartment or are leasing a
      house from a homeowner, the landlord may handle this for you, but
      that is not required. If you request service, provide as much
      advance notice to the utility company as you can, at least one
      week in advance of the date you need service to start. Also, if
      you are relocating, don’t forget to have service turned off at
      your old address. Each company may require you to pay a fee to
      start service. You may also be required to pay a deposit or allow
      the company to check your credit to establish service at your
      home. If any of these companies fails to meet its service
      requirements, file a complaint with the company; you may be able
      to get a refund of your installation fee. If that doesn’t work,
      contact your state’s utility commission (p. 138).

    <p>
      Once you have established service, you should start receiving your
      bills at regular intervals, normally monthly or quarterly. Utility
      bills are based on the amount of energy or water you actually use.
      However, if you live in an apartment complex, the amount you pay
      for some utilities may be prorated or split, based on a
      mathematical formula, among all of the residents in your
      community, no matter how energy conscious you are; see Renting (p.
      30). If the amount of energy varies by season, you may decide to
      sign up for a budget billing program. These programs allow you to
      smooth out your monthly payments by paying more in lighter-use
      months, so your bills are still manageable in months with heavier
      use. Contact your utility companies to sign up for these programs.
      To learn ways to save on your energy bill, see Going Green (p.
      22).

      In addition to your actual service, you may have other fees on
      your bill, such as administrative fees, public surcharges, or
      local taxes. Contact the service provider if you see charges you
      don’t understand or didn’t authorize, or if you have difficulty
      making timely payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have difficulty paying your bills, especially for
      electricity or gas, help is available. Contact the company to find
      out if it has a program in place to help consumers. Also, your
      state’s utility commission (p. 138) may sponsor a program to
      either reduce your bill or make your payments based on a set
      amount of your income each month. Programs like these from utility
      companies and local government are usually based on your income.
