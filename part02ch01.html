    <p>
      Even the savviest consumer has problems with a good or service at
      one time or another. It is your right to complain if you have a
      genuine consumer problem. It is also your responsibility. A
      problem can’t be fixed if no one knows it exists.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35845184"><h1>Contact The Seller</h1>
      
    <p>
      The first step in resolving a consumer problem is contacting the
      seller. You can solve most consumer problems by talking to a
      salesperson or customer service representative. Do this as soon as
      possible because some retailers have time limits on returns and
      refunds. If this doesn’t work, ask for a supervisor or manager. If
      this fails, try going higher up to the national headquarters of
      the seller or the manufacturer of the item. Many companies have a
      special customer relations or consumer affairs division whose
      primary function is solving consumer problems. Many companies
      provide a toll-free number or address for this office on the
      product label, warranty, or other papers you received at the time
      of purchase. If this is not the case:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Check the Corporate Consumer Directory portion of this
          Handbook for the contact information of several hundred
          corporations (p. 72).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Visit the company’s website and look for a “Contact Us” link.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Dial the directory of toll-free numbers at 1-800-555-1212 to
          see whether the company has a toll-free number listed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask your local librarian to assist you. Most public libraries
          have reference books with contact information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          As you do your search, keep in mind that the name of the
          manufacturer or parent company is often different from the
          brand name. The Thomas Register of American Manufacturers, a
          book available at many public libraries, lists the
          manufacturers of thousands of products.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          With each person you contact, calmly and accurately explain
          the problem and what action you would like to be taken. A
          written letter is a good strategy because you will have a
          record of your communication with the company. The sample
          letter (p. 57) will help you prepare a written complaint.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be brief and to the point. Note all important facts about your
          purchase, including what you bought, serial or model numbers,
          the name and location of the seller, and when you made the
          purchase.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          State exactly what you want done about the problem and how
          long you are willing to wait for a response. Be reasonable.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t write an angry, sarcastic, or threatening letter. The
          person reading your letter probably was not responsible for
          your problem but could be very helpful in resolving it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Send your letter as certified mail or request delivery
          confirmation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Include copies of all documents regarding your problem. Keep
          the originals.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Provide your name, address, and phone numbers. If an account
          is involved, be sure to include the account number.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep a record of your efforts to contact the seller; include
          the name of the person with whom you spoke and what was done,
          if anything.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    </section>
  <section data-type="sect1" id="id35845288"><h1>Contact Third Parties</h1>
    
    <p>
      Don’t give up if you are not satisfied with the seller’s response
      to your complaint. Once you have given the seller a reasonable
      amount of time to respond, consider filing a complaint with one or
      more of these outside organizations:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State or local consumer protection offices</strong> 
      (p. 112). These government agencies mediate complaints, conduct 
      investigations, and prosecute those who break consumer laws.
     </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State regulatory agencies</strong> that have jurisdiction 
      over the business. For example, banking (p. 126), insurance
      130), securities (p. 134), and utilities (p. 138) are regulated at
      the state level.

    </aside>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35845364"><h5>File A Complaint Using Social Media</h5>
      
    <p>
      Social media offer an alternative to filing a formal consumer
      complaint. The customer relations staff at many major corporations
      monitor posts and complaints about their company’s service.
      Someone may respond to your problem quickly, to avoid negative
      perceptions of their company’s performance by other potential
      customers. While there is no guarantee that you’ll get your
      problem resolved, it can be a worthwhile effort.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      <strong>Local politicians.</strong> Your local
      and state politicians may be able to help you get your complaint addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State and local licensing
      agencies.</strong> Doctors, lawyers, home improvement
      contractors, auto repair shops, debt collectors, and child care
      providers are required to register or be licensed. The board or
      agency that oversees this process may handle complaints and have
      the authority to take disciplinary action. Your state or local
      consumer protection office (p. 112) can help you identify the
      appropriate agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Better Business Bureaus</strong> (p.
      67). This network of nonprofit organizations supported by local
      businesses tries to resolve buyer complaints against sellers.
      Records are kept on unresolved complaints as a source of
      information for the seller’s future customers. The umbrella
      organization for the BBBs assists with complaints concerning the
      truthfulness of national advertising and helps to settle disputes
      with automobile manufacturers through the BBB AUTO LINE program (p. 66).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trade associations.</strong>
      Companies selling similar products or services often belong to an
      industry association that will help resolve problems between its 
      members and consumers (p. 142).
</p>
    <p>
    <strong>National consumer
      organizations.</strong> Some of these organizations assist 
      consumers with complaints. Others may be
      unable to help individuals but are interested in hearing about
      problems that could influence their education and advocacy efforts
      (p. 109).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Media programs.</strong> Local
      newspapers, radio stations, and television stations often have
      action lines or hotline services that try to resolve consumer
      complaints they receive. Call for Action, Inc. is a nonprofit
      network of consumer hotlines that educate and assist consumers
      with consumer problems. For more information, visit
      <a href="http://www.callforaction.org">www.callforaction.org</a>

  <section data-type="sect1" id="id35845452"><h1>Dispute Resolution Programs</h1>
    
    <p>
      Some companies and industries offer programs to address
      disagreements between buyers and sellers. The auto industry (p.
      66) has several of these programs. The Financial Industry
      Regulatory Authority (FINRA) offers a program to resolve
      investment-related disputes (p. 66). Some small claims courts also
      offer a dispute resolution program as an alternative to a trial.
      The American Bar Association (p. 142) also publishes a directory
      of state and local dispute resolution programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mediation, arbitration, and conciliation are three common types of
      dispute resolution. During mediation, both sides involved in the
      dispute meet with a neutral third party and create their own
      agreement jointly. In arbitration, the third party decides how to
      settle the problem. Conciliation is similar; however, you and the
      other party meet with the conciliator separately (not a group
      meeting). Request a copy of the rules of any program before
      deciding to participate. You will want to know beforehand whether
      the decision is binding; some programs do not require both parties
      to accept the decision. Also ask whether participation in the
      program places any restrictions on your ability to take other
      legal action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some contracts include a clause that prohibits you from taking
      legal action and require you to engage in mandatory arbitration
      with a company in the case of a dispute. The clause may limit your
      ability to take a case to court. Be sure to read contracts
      carefully to see whether they include a mandatory arbitration
      clause. If you do not wish to be prohibited from taking legal
      action if needed, you can choose not to purchase an item from the
      company. If you have no other option, write on the contract that
      you don’t agree with the clause and initial next to the statement.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35845473"><h1>Small Claims Court</h1>
      
    <p>
      Small claims courts resolve disputes over small amounts of money.
      While the maximum amount that can be claimed differs from state to
      state, court procedures are generally simple, inexpensive, quick,
      and informal. Court fees are minimal, and you often get your
      filing fee back if you win your case. Typically, you will not need
      a lawyer— some states do not permit them. If you live in a state
      that allows lawyers, and the party you are suing brings one, don’t
      be intimidated. Most judges make allowances for consumers who
      appear without lawyers. Even though the court is informal, the
      judge’s decision must be followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you file a case and win, the losing party should give you what
      the court says you are owed without further action on your part.
      But some losers refuse to follow the court’s decision. When this
      happens, you can go back to court and ask for the order to be
      enforced. Depending on local laws, law enforcement officials might
      sell a person’s property or take money from a bank account or
      business cash register. If the person who owes the money receives
      a salary, the court might order an employer to garnish (deduct
      money from) each paycheck to pay you.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35845553"><h2>Tips for Choosing an Attorney</h2>
      
    <p>
      Many lawyers who primarily serve individuals and families are
      general practitioners with experience in frequently needed legal
      services, such as divorce and family matters, wills and probate,
      bankruptcy and debt problems, real estate, and criminal and/or
      personal injury. Some have a narrower focus. Be sure the lawyer
      you are considering has experience in the area for which you are
      seeking help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Once you’ve identified some candidates:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Call each attorney on the telephone, describe your legal
          issue, and find out whether he or she handles your situation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask if you will be charged for an initial consultation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for an estimate of what the lawyer usually charges to
          handle your kind of case.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether there are hourly charges or your attorney accepts
          a percentage of the settlement as a fee contingency.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      The initial consultation is an opportunity for you and the lawyer
      to get to know each other. After listening to the description of
      your case, the lawyer should be able to outline your rights and
      liabilities as well as alternative courses of action. The initial
      consultation is the lawyer’s opportunity to explain what he or she
      can do for you and how much it will cost. You should not hesitate
      to ask about the attorney’s experience in handling matters such as
      yours. Also, do not hesitate to ask about the lawyer’s fees and
      the likely results. If you are considering going beyond the
      initial consultation and hiring the lawyer, request a written fee
      agreement before proceeding.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35845604"><h2>What If You Can’t Afford a Lawyer?</h2>
      
    <p>
      If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free legal help
      from a Legal Aid or Legal Services Corporation (LSC) office. These
      offices generally offer legal assistance for such things as
      landlord-tenant relations, credit, utilities, family matters (for
      example, divorce and adoption), foreclosure, home equity fraud,
      Social Security, welfare, unemployment, and workers’ compensation.
    </p>
      <p>
      If the Legal Aid office in your area does not handle your type of
      case, it may refer you to other local, state, or national
      organizations that can provide help. Additional resources may be
      found at <a href="http://www.lawhelp.org">www.lawhelp.org</a> or

      where students, supervised by attorneys, handle a variety of legal
      matters. Some of these programs are open to all; others limit
      their service to specific groups, such as senior citizens or
      low-income persons. Contact a law school in your area to find out

      <section data-type="sect1" id="id35845702"><h1>Report Fraud And Safety Hazard</h1>
        
    <p>
      If you suspect a law has been violated, contact your local or
      state consumer protection agency (p. 112). This agency may take
      action or refer you to another state organization that has
      authority where you live. A local law enforcement officer may also
      be able to provide advice and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violations of federal laws should be reported to the federal
      agency responsible for enforcement. While federal agencies are
      rarely able to act on behalf of individual consumers, complaints
      are used to document patterns of abuse, allowing the agency to
      take action against a company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout Part I of this <em>Handbook</em>, you will
      find references to federal agencies you can contact for more
      information, which is usually the same agency to contact with your
      complaint. You can also find the appropriate federal agency by
      using the Federal Agency Directory (p. 96).

    <p>People who have no intention of delivering what is sold, 
      misrepresent items, sell counterfeit goods, or otherwise 
      try to trick you out of your money are committing fraud.

    <p>
      If you suspect fraud, there are some additional steps to take:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Contact the Federal Trade Commission (p. 107). Please note—the
          FTC does not handle individual consumer complaints.

      </li><li>
        <p>
          Report scams that use the mail or interstate delivery service
          to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (p. 108). It is illegal
          to use the mail to misrepresent or steal money.
