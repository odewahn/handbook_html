      Like everything else you buy, it pays to comparison shop for
      credit. For up-to-date interest rate reports on mortgages, auto
      loans, credit cards, home equity loans, and other banking
      products, visit
      <a href="http://www.bankrate.com">www.bankrate.com</a>. The Equal
      Credit Opportunity Act protects you when dealing with anyone who
      regularly offers credit, including banks, finance companies,
      stores, credit card companies, and credit unions. When you apply
      for credit, a creditor may not:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Ask about or consider your sex, race, national origin, or
          religion

      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask about your marital status or your spouse—unless you are
          applying for a joint account or relying on your spouse’s
          income, or you live in a community property state (Arizona,
          California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas,
          Washington, or Wisconsin)
        </p>
      </li><li>

      </li><li>
        <p>
          Refuse to consider income because of your sex or marital

          benefits
        </p>

      <strong>You have the right to:</strong>

    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Have credit in your birth name, your first name and your

          last name
        </p>
      </li><li>

          Keep your own accounts after you change your name or marital

    <section data-type="sect1" id="credit_cards"><h1>Credit Cards</h1>
      
    <p>
      There are many types of credit cards with various features, but
      there is no one best credit card. The card you use depends
      entirely on how you plan to use it. Are you going to use it for
      everyday purchases or larger purchases? Do you plan to pay your
      balance off each month?
    </p>
    <p>
      When you apply for a credit card, consider:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Annual Percentage Rate
          (APR)</strong>. If the interest rate is variable, how is it
          determined, and when can it change?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Periodic rate</strong>. This is the
          interest rate used to determine the finance charge on your
          balance each billing period.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Annual fee</strong>. While some
          cards have no annual fee, others expect you to pay an amount
          each year for being a cardholder.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Rewards programs.</strong>Can you
          earn points for flights, hotel stays, and gift certificates to
          your favorite retailers? Use the tool on
          <a href="http://www.creditcardtuneup.com">www.creditcardtuneup.com</a>to
          find the card that offers the best rewards for you.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Grace period</strong>. This is the
          number of days you have to pay your bill before finance
          charges start. Without this period, you may have to pay
          interest from the date you use your card or the date the
          purchase is posted to your account.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Finance charges</strong>. Most
          lenders calculate finance charges using an average daily
          account balance, which is the average of what you owed each
          day in the billing cycle. Look for offers that use an adjusted
          balance, which subtracts your payment from your beginning
          balance. This method usually has the lowest finance charges.
          Check whether there is a minimum finance charge.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Other fees</strong>. Ask about fees
        when you get a cash advance, make a late payment, or go over your
        credit limit. Some credit card companies also charge a monthly
        fee. Be careful: sometimes companies may also try to upsell by
        offering other services such as credit protection, insurance, or
        debt coverage. Visit

    <p>
      The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure
      (CARD) Act brought about sweeping protections for consumers. Among
      other things, your credit card company must comply with the rules
      below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fees</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Cannot change rates or fees without sending you a notice 45
          days in advance in most cases
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cannot charge you a late payment fee of more than $25,
          regardless of how much you owe—unless one of your last six
          payments was late or the credit card company can justify a
          higher fee based on the cost of late payments
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Payments</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Has to tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance
          if you make only minimum payments
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Must mail or deliver your credit card bill at least 21 days
          before your payment is due
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Interest Rates</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Cannot increase your rate for the first 12 months after you
          open an account unless you have a variable interest rate or an
          introductory rate; you are more than 60 days late paying your
          bill; or you are in a workout agreement and don’t make
          payments as arranged
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cannot charge higher rates for purchases made before you receive 
          notice of a new rate
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      What’s more, a credit card
      company can grant credit cards to consumers under age 21 only if
      they can show they are able to make payments or have a cosigner
      for the card. More information about CARD Act protections is
      available from

    <p>
      To complain about a problem with your credit card company, call
      the number on the back of your card or try to resolve it with the
      CFPB (p. 96). If you fail to resolve the issue, ask for the name,
      address, and phone number of the card company’s regulatory agency.
      See the chart on page 7 to find the best federal or state
      regulatory agency to contact.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35835477"><h2>Credit Card Billing Disputes</h2>
    
    <p>
      Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you have the right to dispute
      charges on your credit card that you didn’t make, are incorrect,
      or are for goods or services you didn’t receive.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Send a letter to the creditor within 60 days of the statement
          date of the bill with the disputed charge.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Include your name and account number, the date and amount of
          the disputed charge, and a complete explanation of why you are
          disputing the charge. To ensure it’s received, send your
          letter by certified mail, with a return receipt requested.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The creditor or card issuer must acknowledge your letter in
          writing within 30 days of receiving it and conduct an
          investigation within 90 days. You do not have to pay the
          amount in dispute during the investigation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If there was an error, the creditor must credit your account
          and remove any fees.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If the bill is correct, you must be told in writing what you
          owe and why. You must then pay it, along with any related
          finance charges.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <p>
      A credit report contains information on where you work and live,
      how you pay your bills, and whether you’ve been sued or arrested
      or have filed for bankruptcy. Credit reporting agencies (CRAs)
      gather this information and sell it to creditors, employers,
      insurers, and others. The most common type of CRA is the credit
      bureau. There are three major credit bureaus:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Equifax: 1-800-685-1111 or

   <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35835597"><h5>Beware: “Credit Repair” Scams</h5>
   
    <p>
      Before you sign up for fee-based credit repair services,
      beware. Many of the promised services are either illegal or
      are ones you can do for free by yourself. Before you sign
      up to work with these companies, here are some tidbits to
      keep in mind:
    </p>
     <ul><li>
         <p>A credit repair company must give you a copy of the
           “Consumer Credit File Rights under State and Federal
           Law” before you sign a contract.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>The company cannot perform any services until you
           have signed a written contract and completed a threeday
           waiting period, during which time you can cancel the
           contract without paying any fees.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>The company cannot charge you until it has completed
           the promised services, according to the Credit Repair
           Organizations Act.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>It is illegal to erase timely and accurate negative
           information contained in your credit history.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>Suggestions that you create a new credit history (also
           called file segregation) by requesting an Employer
           Identification Number from the IRS are also illegal.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>You can solve your own credit challenges by
           requesting a free copy of your credit report through
           <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>, 
           and by working with creditors to dispute incorrect information.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35835661"><h2>FICO</h2>
      
    <p>
      The information in your credit report is used to calculate your
      FICO score, a number generally between 300 and 850. The acronym 
      stands for Fair, Isaac and Company. The higher
      your score, the less risk you pose to creditors. A high score, for
      example, makes it easier for you to obtain a loan, rent an
      apartment, or lower your insurance rate. Your FICO score is
      available from
      <a href="http://www.myfico.com">www.myfico.com</a>for a fee. Free
      credit reports do not contain your credit score, although you can
      purchase it when you request your free annual credit report
      through

    </p>
    </section>
      <section data-type="sect2" id="id35835688"><h2>Tips for Building a Better Credit Score</h2>
    
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Pay your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections
          negatively affect your score.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep balances low on credit cards and other “revolving
          credit.” High outstanding debt lowers your score.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed. Don’t
          open an account just to have a better credit mix; it probably
          won’t raise your score.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Pay off debt instead of moving it around. Owing the same
          amount, but having fewer open accounts, may lower your score.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      You don’t rebuild your credit score; you rebuild your credit
      history. Time is your ally in improving credit. There is no “quick
      fix” for a bad credit score, so be suspicious of any deals that
      offer you a fast, easy solution.
    </p>
      </section>
      <section data-type="sect2" id="id35835736"><h2>Negative Information in Your Credit Report</h2>
    
    <p>
      Negative information concerning your use of credit can be kept in
      your credit report for seven years. A bankruptcy can be kept for
      10 years, and unpaid tax liens for 15 years. Information about a
      lawsuit or an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for
      seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out,
      whichever is longer. Inquiries remain on your report for two
      years.

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35835749"><h5>Debt Collection E-mails</h5>
      
    <p>
      When communicating with consumers through email, debt collectors
      must observe the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). It is
      important for you and creditors or collection agencies to save and
      store copies of all communication, which will be important if
      there is a disagreement later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take steps towards maintaining privacy, conduct all communications 
      via email using either secure email platforms or industry-specific 
      communication platforms. Never give a workplace email account as 
      a contact address, as there is no legal expectation of privacy 
      for a workplace email account.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Anyone who denies you credit, housing, insurance, or a job as a
      result of a credit report must give you the name, address, and
      telephone number of the CRA that provided the report. Under the
      Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you have the right to request a
      free report within 60 days if a company denies you credit based on
      the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit
      report:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Contact the CRA and the company that provided the information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Tell the CRA in writing what information you believe is
          inaccurate. Keep a copy of all correspondence.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Under the FCRA, the information provider is required to

      Immediately call the card issuer when you suspect a credit or
      charge card has been lost or stolen. Once you report the loss or
      theft of a card, you have no further responsibility for
      unauthorized charges. In any event, your maximum liability under

      Credit repair companies advertise that they can erase bad credit
      for a hefty fee. Don’t believe it. Under the Credit Repair
      Organizations Act, credit repair companies can’t require you to
      pay until they have completed promised services. They must also
      give you:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          A copy of the “Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and
          Federal Law” before you sign a contract
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A written contract that spells out your rights and obligations
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Three days to cancel without paying any fees
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Some credit
      repair companies promise to help you establish a whole new
      credit identity. You can be charged with fraud if you use the
      mail or telephone to apply for credit with false information.
      It is also a federal crime to make false statements on a loan
      or credit application, to give a false Social Security number,
      or to obtain an Employer Identification Number from the
      Internal Revenue Service under false pretenses. If you have
      lost money to a credit repair scam, contact your state or local
      consumer affairs office (p. 112).

    <p>
      If you want to reduce your amount of debt, you can do some work on
      your own. First, develop a realistic budget so you can see your
      income and expenses in one place and look for ways to save money.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35835884"><h2>Debt Collection</h2>
      
    <p>
      The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies to those who
      collect debts owed to creditors for personal, family, and
      household expenditures. These debts include car loans, mortgages,
      charge accounts, and money owed for medical bills. A debt
      collector is someone hired to collect money you owe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within five days after a debt collector first contacts you, the
      collector must send you a notice that tells you the name of the
      creditor, how much you owe, and what action to take if you believe
      you don’t owe the money. If you owe the money or part of it,
      contact the creditor to arrange for payment. If you believe you
      don’t owe the money, contact the creditor in writing and send a
      copy to the collection agency with a letter telling it not to
      contact you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A debt collector may not:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Contact you at unreasonable times, for example, before 8 am or
          after 9 pm, unless you agree

          Contact you after you write a letter telling the collector to
          stop, except to notify you if the collector or creditor plans
          to take a specific action
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact your friends, relatives, employer, or others, except

        <p>
          Make any false statement or claim you will be arrested

      <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35835978"><h5>Peer-to-Peer Lending</h5>
        
    <p>
      Peer to peer lending (P2P), or social lending, is a new process of
      connecting an individual borrower with lenders, without using
      traditional banks to obtain an unsecured loan. As a potential
      borrower, you can post a request for a loan, along with a brief
      description of how you will use it. The borrower and lenders are
      strangers; their only knowledge of each other is through the P2P
      website. Although the idea seems very informal, a peer-to-peer
      loan contract is a formal, legally binding agreement between two
      parties; checks and pay stubs are required. There can still be
      fees for late and missed payments. The lenders must report your
      loan payment history to the credit reporting agencies. For more
      information about peer-to-peer lending, visit
      <a href="http://www.consumeraction.org/news/articles/2012_p2p_lending_survey/#primer">www.consumeraction.org/news/articles/2012_p2p_lending_survey/#primer</a>.

          Typically, a counseling service will negotiate lower payments with
          your creditors, and then make the payments using money you send to
          it each month. The cost of setting up this debt-management plan is
          paid by the creditor, not you. Ask these questions to find the best
          counselor for you:
        </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          What services do you offer? Look for an organization that
          offers budget counseling and money management classes as well
          as debt-management planning.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you offer free information? Avoid organizations that charge
          for information or make you provide a lot of details about
          your problem first.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What are your fees? Are there set-up and/or monthly fees? A
          typical set-up fee is $10. Beware of agencies that charge
          large up-front fees.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How will the debt-management plan work? What debts can be
          included in the plan, and will you get regular reports on your
          accounts?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether the counselor can get creditors to lower or
          eliminate interest and fees. If the answer is yes, contact
          your creditors to verify this.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask what happens if you can’t afford to pay. If an
          organization won’t help you because you can’t afford to pay,
          go somewhere else for help.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will your counselor help you avoid future problems? Getting a
          plan for avoiding future debt is as important as solving the
          immediate debt problem.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for a contract. All verbal promises should be in writing
          before you pay any money.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are your counselors accredited or certified? Legitimate credit
          counseling firms are affiliated with the NFCC (p. 145) or the 
          Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies 
          (p. 143).

    <section data-type="sect1" id="loans"><h1>Loans</h1>
      
    <p>
      There are different types of loans. Some are secured loans. This
      mean that your property and things you own are used as collateral,
      and if you cannot pay back the loan, the lender will take your
      collateral to get their money back. Other types of loans,
      unsecured loans, don’t use property as collateral. Lenders
      consider these as more risky than secured loans, so they charge a
      higher interest rate for them. Most credit cards are unsecured
      loans, although some consumers have secured credit cards. Two very
      common secured loans are home equity and installment loans.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35836180"><h2>Home Equity Loans</h2>
      
    <p>
      A home equity loan is a form of credit where your home is used as
      collateral for the loan. This type of loan is often used to pay
      for major expenses, such as education, medical bills, and home
      repairs. Consider carefully before taking out a home equity loan.
      If you are unable to make payments on time, you could lose your
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home equity loans can be either a revolving line of credit or a
      lump sum. Revolving credit lets you withdraw funds when you need
      them. A lump sum is a one-time, closed-end loan for a particular
      purpose, such as remodeling or tuition. Apply for a home equity
      loan through a bank or credit union first. These loans are likely
      to cost less than those offered by finance companies.

        buying, leasing, renting, or repairing a home.</p>

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35836205"><h2>Installment Loans</h2>
      
      <p>
        Installment loans are loans that are repaid over time with
        a set number of scheduled payments; the most common
        installment loans are home or car loans. Before you sign
        an agreement for a loan to buy a house, a car, or other
        large purchase, make sure you fully understand all of the
        lender’s terms and conditions, including:
      </p>

           The dollar amount you are borrowing
          </p>

            The payment amounts and when they are due
          </p>

          <p>
            The total finance charge, including all interest and fees

          <p>
            The APR, the rate of interest you will pay over the full
            term of the loan
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Penalties for late payments

          <p>
            Penalties if you pay the loan back early

          The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to give you this
          information so you can compare different offers.

      <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35836271"><h5>Payday and Tax Refund Loans</h5>
        
        <p>
          Payday loans are designed to stretch your budget until
          your payday. Beware; these loans charge high annual
          interest rates and excessive fees that are due every few
          weeks. Because of these excessive fees, payday loans
          are illegal in some states and for all members of the
          military. With a typical payday loan, you might write a
          personal check for $115 to borrow $100 for two weeks,
          until payday. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in this
          example is 390%! If you can repay the loan quickly, it
          may not appear to be such a bad deal. But if you have to
          renew the loan, that relatively small loan can grow into a
          major debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another high-cost way to borrow money is a tax refund
          loan. This type of credit lets you get an advance on a
          tax refund—for a fee. APRs as high as 774% have been
          reported. If you’re short of cash, avoid both of these
          loans by asking for more time to pay a bill or seeking a
          traditional short-term bank loan.
