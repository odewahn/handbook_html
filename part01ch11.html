      General sources of insurance information include the American
      Council of Life Insurers (p. 142), the Insurance Information
      Institute (p. 144), the National Association of Insurance
      Commissioners (p. 145), and your state insurance department (p.
      130). You can also visit

    <p>
      When buying any type of insurance (home, life, auto, rental, or
      other), you should:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
      Find out whether your state insurance department (p. 130) offers 
      any information concerning insurance companies and
      rates. This is a good way to get a feeling for the range of prices
      and the lowest-cost providers in your area.
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Check several sources for the best deal. Try getting quotes
          online, but be aware that many online services may provide
          prices for just a few companies. An independent insurance
          agent who works with several insurers in your area may be able
          to get you a better deal.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure the insurance company is licensed and covered by the
          state’s guaranty fund. The fund pays claims in case the
          company defaults. Your state insurance department (p. 130) can
          provide this information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check the financial stability and soundness of the insurance
          company. Ratings from A.M. Best
          (<a href="http:www.ambest.com"/>), Standard
          &amp; Poor’s (<a href="http:www.standardandpoors.com"/>),
          and Moody’s Investors Services
          (<a href="http://www.moodys.com"/>) are available online and at most
          public libraries.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Research the complaint record of the company. Contact your
          state insurance department (p. 130), or visit the website of
          the National Association of Insurance
          Commissioners (<a href="http:www.naic.org"/>),
          which has a database of complaints filed with state
          regulators.
        </p>

        </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Once you pay your first insurance premium, make sure you receive
      a written policy. This tells you that the agent forwarded your
      premium to the insurance company. If you don’t receive a policy
      within 60 days, contact your agent and the insurance company.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35839950"><h1>Auto Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      The requirements for auto insurance vary from state to state.
      Check with your state insurance regulator (p. 130) to learn more
      about individual requirements as well as insurers you may be
      considering for your policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the best coverage at the best price, get several quotes
      from insurance companies; it may save you hundreds of dollars a
      year. Other ways to reduce your insurance premium include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Raise your deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage.
          If you have an older car, you might want to drop this coverage
          altogether.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Take advantage of discounts. You may be eligible for a
          discount based on the number of miles you drive; your age
          (turning 25 or 50); your good grades if you are a student;
          your driving record (no moving vehicle violations or accidents
          in three years); or if you’ve taken a safe-driving course. You
          might also be able to get discounts if you insure more than
          one vehicle, insure your vehicle and your home with the same
          company, have anti-theft devices, or have safety features such
          as air bags or anti-lock brake system.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35839987"><h1>Disability Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      Disability can be more disastrous financially than death. If you
      are disabled, you lose your earning power, but you still have
      living expenses and often huge fees for medical care. Disability
      insurance helps you replace lost income. Many employers offer some
      type of disability insurance coverage for employees, or you can
      get an individual disability insurance policy. There are two types
      of disability policies: short-term disability (STD) and long-term
      disability (LTD). Short-term disability policies have a maximum
      benefit of two years, while long-term disability policies have
      benefits that can last the rest of your life. When purchasing
      disability insurance, ask:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>How is disability defined?</strong>
          Some policies consider you disabled if you are unable to
          perform the duties of any job. Better plans pay benefits if
          you are unable to do the usual duties of your own occupation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>When do benefits begin?</strong>
          Most plans have a waiting period after an illness before
          payments begin.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35840025"><h5>Insurance Vocabulary</h5>
      
    <p>
      <strong>Claim</strong>—a request for your
      insurance provider to pay for services provided by a medical
      professional
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Co-payment (co-pay)</strong>—the amount,
      set by your insurer, that you pay when you receive medical service
      or for a prescription
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deductible</strong>—amount you must pay
      before your insurance company will pay a claim. There are multiple
      types of deductibles, but in general, a lower deducible will have
      a higher-cost policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of benefits (EOB)</strong>—a
      statement from your health insurance company that shows what 
      claims it has paid on your behalf

    </p>
    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>How long do benefits last?</strong>
          After the waiting period, payments are usually available until
          you reach age 65, though shorter or longer terms are also
          available.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What dollar amount is
          promised?</strong> Can benefits be reduced by Social
          Security disability and workers’ compensation payments? Are
          the benefits adjusted for inflation? Will the policy provider
          continue making contributions to your pension plan so you have
          retirement benefits when the disability coverage ends?

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35840117"><h2>Affordable Care Act</h2>
      
    <p>
      The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) puts in place comprehensive
      health insurance reforms that will roll out over several years.
      Most provisions will take effect by 2014; a timeline is available
      at
      <a href="healthcare.gov/law/timeline">healthcare.gov/law/timeline</a>. The
      law is intended to lower health care costs, provide more health
      care choices, and enhance the quality of health care for all
      Americans. Major provisions affecting consumers include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Coverage for seniors who hit the Medicare Prescription Drug
          “donut hole,” including a rebate for those who reach the gap
          in drug coverage.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Expanded coverage for young adults, allowing them to stay on
          their parents’ plan until they are 26 years old.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Providing access to insurance for uninsured Americans with
          pre-existing conditions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Expanded preventive care (for example, wellness visits and
          mammograms) to Medicare and Medicaid participants.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Medical coverage to children not eligible for care under
          Medicaid.
        </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      In 2013, you can set aside up to $2,500 in a flexible spending
      account (FSA) for medical expenses that aren’t covered by
      insurance.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35840193"><h2>Group Policies</h2>
      
    <p>
      Many consumers have health care coverage from their employers.
      Others have medical care paid through a government program such as
      Medicare (p. 100), Medicaid (p. 100), or the Veterans Health 
      Administration (p. 105).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have lost your group coverage from an employer as the result of
      unemployment, death, divorce, or loss of “dependent child” status,
      you may be able to continue your coverage temporarily under the
      Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). You, not
      the employer, pay for this coverage. When one of these events 
      occurs, you must be given at least 60 days to decide
      whether you wish to purchase the coverage.
    </p>
      <p>
      Some states offer an
      insurance pool to residents who are unable to obtain coverage 
      because of a health condition. To find
      out whether a pool is available in your state, check with your
      state department of insurance (p. 130).

        <p>
          <strong>Medicaid</strong> provides health

      <section data-type="sect1" id="id35840281"><h1>Health Care Plans</h1>
    
    <p>
      When purchasing health insurance, your choices typically will fall
      into one of three categories:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Traditional</strong> fee-for-service
          health insurance plans are usually the most expensive choice,
          but they offer you the most flexibility in choosing health
          care providers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)</strong> 
          offer lower co-payments and cover the costs of more preventive
      care, but your choice of health care providers is limited. The
      National Committee for Quality Assurance evaluates and accredits
      HMOs. You can find out whether one is accredited in your state by
      calling 1-888-275-7585. You can also get this information, as well
      as report cards on HMOs, by visiting
      <a href="http://www.ncqa.org">www.ncqa.org</a>.
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Preferred provider organizations
      (PPOs)</strong> offer lower co-payments like HMOs, but give you
      more flexibility in selecting a provider. A PPO gives you a list
      of providers you can choose from.
    </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>WARNING: If you go outside the HMO or PPO network of providers,
        you may have to pay a portion or all of the cost.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When choosing among different health care plans, you’ll need to
      read the fine print and ask lots of questions, such as:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Do I have the right to go to any doctor, hospital, clinic, or
          pharmacy I choose?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are specialists such as eye doctors and dentists covered?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the plan cover special conditions or treatments such as
          pregnancy, psychiatric care, and physical therapy?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the plan cover home care or nursing home care?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will the plan cover all medications my physician may
          prescribe?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What are the deductibles? Are there any co-payments?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What is the most I will have to pay out of my own pocket to
          cover expenses?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If there is a dispute about a bill or service, how is it
          handled? In some plans, you may be required to have a third
          party decide how to settle the problem.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
      </section>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35840400"><h1>Homeowners/Renters Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year on homeowners
      insurance by shopping around. You can also save money by following
      these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Consider a higher deductible. Increasing your deductible by
          just a few hundred dollars can make a big difference in your
          premiums.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask your insurance agent about discounts. You may be able to
          get a lower premium if your home has safety features such as
          dead-bolt locks, smoke detectors, an alarm system, storm
          shutters, or fire-retardant roofing material. Persons over 
          55 years of age or long-term customers may also be offered discounts.
    </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
          Insure your house, NOT the land under it. After a disaster,
          the land is still there. If you don’t subtract the value of
          the land when deciding how much homeowners insurance to buy,
          you will pay more than you should.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t wait until you have a loss to find out whether you have
          the right type and amount of insurance.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make certain you purchase enough coverage to replace what is
          insured. “Replacement” coverage gives you the money to rebuild
          your home and replace its contents. An “Actual Cash Value”
          policy is cheaper but pays the difference between your
          property’s worth at the time of loss minus depreciation for
          age and wear.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask about any special coverage you might need. You may have to
          pay extra for computers, cameras, jewelry, art, antiques,
          musical instruments, stamp collections, etc.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Remember that flood and earthquake damage are not covered by a
          standard homeowners policy. The cost of a separate earthquake
          policy will depend on the likelihood of earthquakes in your
          area. Homeowners who live in areas prone to flooding should
          take advantage of the National Flood Insurance Program (p. 102).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you are a renter, do not assume your landlord carries
          insurance on your personal belongings. Purchase a separate policy
          for renters.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35840482"><h1>Life Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      Your need for life insurance will change with changes in your
      life. For example, the arrival of children usually triggers a
      sharp increase in the amount you will need. As children grow older
      and leave the nest, you will probably need less protection. You
      should also consider your life insurance policies as you are
      planning for retirement (p. 37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Term life insurance policies are the least costly. They pay death
      benefits but have no cash value if you decide to stop making
      payments. As the word “term” suggests, these policies are in
      effect for a specific period—one year or until you reach a certain
      age are common. Visit
      <a href="http://www.accuquote.com">www.accuquote.com</a> for
      online comparisons of term life insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whole life, universal life, and other cash value policies combine
      a long-term savings and investment product with life insurance.
      Canceling these policies after only a few years can more than
      double your life insurance costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have misplaced a life insurance policy, your state’s
      insurance commission may be able to help you locate it. Or you can
      search for it at
      <a href="http://www.policylocator.org">www.policylocator.org</a>. If
      the insurance company knows that an insured person has
      died, but cannot locate the beneficiaries, the company must turn
      the benefits over to the state’s unclaimed property office. Check 
      with that office if you believe that you are due a benefit.
    </p>
      <p>
      You can avoid losing your life insurance policy by
      alerting the policy beneficiaries and filing a copy with your
      will.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35840538"><h1>Long-Term Care Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      Medical advances have resulted in greater need for nursing home
      care and assisted living. Most health insurance plans and Medicare
      severely limit or exclude long-term care. You should consider
      these costs as you plan for your retirement (p. 37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some questions to ask when considering a separate
      long-term care insurance policy:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What qualifies you for
          benefits?</strong> Some insurers say you must be unable to
          perform a specific number of the following activities of daily
          living: eating, walking, getting from bed to a chair,
          dressing, bathing, using the restroom, and remaining

          <strong>What type of care is
          covered?</strong> Does the policy cover nursing home care?
          What about coverage for assisted-living facilities that
          provide less client care than a nursing home? If you want to
          stay in your home, will it pay for care provided by visiting
          nurses and therapists? What about help with food preparation
          and housecleaning?
        </p>

          <strong>What will the benefit amount
          be?</strong> Most plans are written to provide a specific
          dollar benefit per day. The benefit for home care is usually
          about half the nursing home benefit, but some policies pay the
          same for both forms of care. Other plans pay only for your
          actual expenses.

          <strong>What is the benefit period?</strong>
          It is possible to get a policy with lifetime benefits, but
          this can be very expensive. Other options for coverage are
          from one to six years. The average nursing home stay is about
          2.5 years.

        <p>
          <strong>Is the benefit adjusted for
          inflation?</strong> If you buy a policy before age 60, you
          face the risk that a fixed daily benefit will not be enough by
          the time you need it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Is there a waiting period before benefits begin?</strong> 
          A 20- to 100-day period is not unusual. See page 26 for more 
          information about advance medical directives.
