      “Going Green” means practicing an environmentally friendly and
      ecologically responsible lifestyle as well as making decisions to
      help protect the environment and sustain natural resources. There
      are lots of reasons to consider going green—too much trash,
      greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, damage to the ozone
      layer, and saving money. For example, switching all of the light
      bulbs in a home from conventional incandescent light bulbs to
      compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs could save about $40 over
      the life of the bulb. Other examples include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Turn your thermostat down two degrees in winter and up two
          degrees in summer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure your walls and ceilings are well insulated.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Replace bathroom and kitchen faucets with low-flow models.

        <p>
          ENERGY STAR-qualified
          appliances use about 33% less
          energy than standard units. You
          can find the ENERGY STAR logo
          on TVs, clothes washers and
          dryers, water heaters, furnaces.
          and many other products.

      <p>
        Home electronics that have
        earned the ENERGY STAR rating deliver exceptional
        features while using less energy. Saving energy helps
        you save money on utility bills and helps to protect the
        environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
        to counter climate change. For more information, visit

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35837702"><h5>Beware: Verify Green Marketing Claims</h5>
      
      <p>
        The number of products claiming they are “eco-friendly”
        or “all-natural” has increased due to a growing demand
        for “green” products. You may be unsure about which
        environmental standards and labels can be trusted. You
        can use the FTC’s Green Guides (<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427"/>) 
        as a resource to verify that the
        environmental attributes or products are truthful. Here are
        some tips to help you sort through eco-label marketing:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
      Look for specific (for example, “contains 75% postconsumer
      recycled materials”) rather than vague
      statements about environmental impact.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Determine whether the green marketing claims apply to
            the packaging, the product, or both.            
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
      Beware of fake third-party certification. Visit Consumer
      Reports’ website (<a href="http://www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels">www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels</a>)
      to find reliable environmental labels.
          </p>

            For more information about environmental advertising and
            labeling, contact the FTC (p. 107) or EPA (p. 105).

    <p>
      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
      <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts">has a green products web
      portal (www.epa.gov/</a>greenerproducts) to help you navigate
      the complex world of green products. The EPA also has a number of
      eco-labeling partnership programs to help you identify greener,
      safer, and more efficient products. Look for these EPA program
      labels when buying:

      eco-friendly clothing. For more information about national
      standards covering organic food, go to the

      <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0">www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0</a>.
      There are no national standards for organic clothing, but
      some fabrics to consider include organic cotton, bark cloth,
      bamboo, and organic wool.

      By making greener product choices, you are saving money on
      utilities and fuel, and protecting public health and the
      environment.

    <p>
      You can make a big impact by using the products you buy in ways
      that respect the environment:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Use fewer products and follow instructions for product use.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Conserve energy, water, and materials.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Recycle items made of materials such as glass, metal, plastic,
          or paper.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Dispose of products properly.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Many utility companies now offer
      curbside recycling programs that provide U.S. households with
      a responsible and convenient way to recycle materials. To
      locate information on recycling services and efforts in 
      your area, visit Earth 911’s website
      (<a href="http://www.earth911.org"/>) or call its toll-free hotline,
      1-800-CLEANUP (253-2687).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to dispose of many products safely. Others, such 
      as car batteries, cell phones, televisions, paints, oils, and
      solvents, require special handling. You can dispose of these
      products responsibly through your local household hazardous waste
      (HHW) collection facility or at your local government’s annual HHW
      collection day. Some items may be given to charitable
      organizations or even dropped off at electronics retailers.
      Contact the EPA (p. 105) to help you make the right decisions about the best way
      to dispose of waste.
