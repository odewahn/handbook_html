      As a savvy consumer, you should always be on the alert for shady
      deals and scams. To avoid becoming a victim, keep these things in
      mind:
    </p>
    <ol><li>
        <p>
          A deal that sounds too good to be true usually is! Be wary of
          promises to fix you credit problems, low-interest credit card
          offers, deals that let you skip credit card payments,
          work-at-home job opportunities, risk-free investments, and
          free travel.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t share personal information with someone you don’t trust.
          Learn how to recognize fraud.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Beware of payday and tax refund loans. Interest rates on these
          loans are usually excessive. A cash advance on a credit card
          may be a better option.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Read and understand any contract or legal document you are
          asked to sign. Do not sign a contract with blank spaces or
          where the terms are incomplete. Some contracts include a
          clause that prohibits you from taking legal action and require
          you to engage in mandatory arbitration with a company in the
          case of a dispute.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get estimates from several contractors for home or car
          repairs. Make sure the estimates are for the exact same
          repairs for a fair comparison.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Before you buy, make sure you understand and accept the
          store’s refund and return policies, especially for services
          and facilities that charge monthly fees.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          When paying for your purchases, double-check the final price.
          If you think the price that has been charged is incorrect,
          speak up. Remember, when shopping online, your purchase may
          include additional fees, such as shipping, handling, and
          convenience fees that are not calculated until you check out.
        </p>
      </li></ol>
    <p>
      7. When shopping online, look for the padlock icon in the bottom
      corner of your screen or a URL that begins with “https” to ensure
      that your payment information is transmitted securely.
    </p>
    <ol><li>
        <p>
          Don’t buy under stress. Avoid making big-ticket purchases
          during times of duress (e.g., coping with a death or debt).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you are having difficulty making payments on loans, notify
          your lender immediately so that you can work out a payment
          plan.
        </p>
