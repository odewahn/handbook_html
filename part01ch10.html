    <p>
      When choosing among housing options, there are many decisions you
      must make. Should you rent or buy? If you buy, what sort of
      financing should you choose, and what type of mortgages is best
      for you? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
      (HUD) funds housing counseling agencies throughout the country to
      help you make these decisions. These organizations can give you
      advice on buying a home, renting, defaults, foreclosures, credit
      issues, and reverse mortgages. To contact the agency nearest you,
      call 1-800-569-4287 or visit
      <a href="http://www.hud.gov">www.hud.gov</a>. Homeowners with
      problems that could result in default on their mortgage or
      foreclosure on their property are encouraged to contact a
      HUD-approved housing counseling agency immediately.

      housing search because of your race, color, nationality, religion,

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35838792"><h1>Buying A Home</h1>
      
    <p>
      Buying a home is one of the most complex financial decisions
      you’ll ever make. In addition to the financial and legal issues
      involved, real estate agents and lenders may not be acting in your
      best interest.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Real estate agents represent the seller, not the buyer.
          Consider hiring a buyer’s agent who works for you, not for the
          seller.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get prices on other homes. Knowing the price of other homes in
          a neighborhood will help you avoid paying too much.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Have the property inspected. Use a licensed home inspector to
          inspect the property carefully before you agree to buy it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check to see if a particular home requires you to pay any
          ongoing homeowners association or condo fees.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35838843"><h2>Mortgages</h2>
      
    <p>
      When shopping for a home mortgage, make sure you obtain all of the
      relevant information:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Research current interest rates. Check the real estate section
          of your local newspaper, use the Internet, or call at least
          six lenders for information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check the rates for 15-year, 20-year, and 30-year mortgages.
          You may be able to save thousands of dollars in interest
          charges by getting the shortest-term mortgage you can afford.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for details on the same loan amount, loan term, and type
          of loan from multiple lenders so you can compare the
          information. Be sure to get the APR, which takes into account
          not only the interest rate, but also points, broker fees, and
          other credit charges expressed as a yearly rate.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether the rate is fixed or adjustable. The interest rate
          on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) can vary a great deal over
          the lifetime of the mortgage. An increase of several percentage 
          points might raise payments by hundreds of dollars per month.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35838884"><h5>Underwater/Upside-down Mortgages</h5>
      
    <p>
      When describing a mortgage in trouble, the terms “underwater” or
      “upside-down” mean the same thing— when the amount of money you
      still have to pay on the loan is more than the actual value of the
      loan. For more information about underwater or upside-down
      mortgages, visit 
      <a href="http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/fallen-value-help">www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/fallen-value-help</a>.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          If a loan has an adjustable rate, ask when and how the rate
          and loan payment can change.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out how much of a down payment is required. Some lenders
          require 20% of the home’s purchase price as a down payment.
          But many lenders now offer loans that require less. In these
          cases, you may be required to purchase private mortgage
          insurance (PMI) to protect the lender if you fall behind on
          payments.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If PMI is required, ask what the total cost of the insurance
          will be. How much will the monthly mortgage payment be when
          the PMI premium is added, and how long you will be required to
          carry PMI?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether you can pay off the loan early, and whether there 
          is a penalty for doing so. 
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
     There is a long list of sources
      for mortgage loans: mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, banks,
      thrifts and credit unions, home builders, real estate agencies,
      and Internet lenders.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35838969"><h2>Mortgage Transfers</h2>
      
    <p>
      CFPB rules help mortgage borrowers by requiring that mortgage
      companies notify them when their loans are transferred to another
      company. The rules ensure that you know who owns your loan, which
      is important information if you have questions or payment disputes
      or want to discuss loan modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these rules, the company that takes over your loan must send
      you a notice within 30 days of acquiring it. Even with a new loan
      owner, the company that “services” or handles your loan might not
      change, and you might continue to send your mortgage payments to
      the same address. If that loan servicer changes, you will receive
      a separate notice.
    </p>
    <p>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35839006"><h1>Avoiding Foreclosure</h1>
      
    <p>
      If you miss your mortgage payments, foreclosure may occur. This is
      the legal means your lender can use to repossess your home. If you
      owe more than your property is worth, a deficiency judgment is
      pursued. Both foreclosures and deficiency judgments have a
      negative impact on your future credit. You should avoid
      foreclosure if at all possible.

    <p>
      Consider refinancing your mortgage if you can get a rate that is
      at least one percentage point lower than your existing mortgage
      rate and if you plan to keep the new mortgage for several years.
      When comparing mortgages, don’t forget to include the extra fees
      you must pay for the new mortgage. You may be able to get some
      fees waived if you are able to refinance with your current
      mortgage holder.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35839315"><h1>Moving Companies</h1>
      
    <p>
      Not all moving companies are the same. Although many are
      legitimate, some attempt to take advantage of their clients.
      Follow these guidelines to help you choose the right mover:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Get a written estimate from several
      movers.</strong> Be wary of very low estimates. Some companies
      quote a low price to get a contract and later ask for more money
      before they will remove your belongings from their truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Make sure the mover has an operating license.</strong> 
      For moves from one state to another, visit
      <a href="http://www.protectyourmove.gov">www.protectyourmove.gov</a>
      to verify a mover’s license. For moves within a state, check your
      state, county, or local consumer affairs agency (p. 112).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Make sure the mover has
      insurance.</strong> If furniture is damaged during the move, the
      mover’s insurance should cover it. Ask how to file a complaint if
      there are limits to the coverage. For more information about the
      levels of mover’s insurance coverage, visit <a href="http://www.protectyourmove.gov/consumer/awareness/valuation/valuation-insurance.htm">www.protectyourmove.gov/consumer/awareness/valuation/valuation-insurance.htm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check
      the mover’s record.</strong> Contact your state or local
      consumer protection agency (p. 112) or the Better Business Bureau
      (p. 67) to see whether there is a history of complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a dispute with a moving company, you can file a
      complaint with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration by
      calling 1-888-368-7238 or by visiting

    <p>
      Home improvements and repairs can cost thousands of dollars and
      are the subject of frequent complaints. When selecting a
      contractor:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Get recommendations and references. Talk to friends, family,
          and others who have used the contractor for similar work.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get at least three written estimates. Insist the contractors
          come to your home to evaluate what needs to be done. Be sure
          the estimates are based on the same work so you can make
          meaningful comparisons.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check contractor complaint records with your state or local
          consumer protection agency (p. 112) or the Better Business
          Bureau (p. 67).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure the contractor meets licensing and registration
          requirements. Your state or local consumer protection agency
          (p. 112) can help you determine the necessary requirements.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get the names of suppliers and ask them whether the contractor
          makes timely payments.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact your local building inspection department to check for
          permit and inspection requirements. Be wary if the contractor
          asks you to get the permit; it could mean the firm is not
          licensed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be sure your contractor is insured. The contractor should have
          personal liability, property damage, and workers’ compensation
          insurance for workers and subcontractors. Also check with your
          insurance company to find out whether you are covered for any
          injury or damage that might occur.

            the title to your home “temporarily” to the scam artist who 
            promises to obtain better financing for your mortgage and 
            allow you to stay in your home as a renter with the option 
            to purchase the home back. However, if you do not comply 
            with the terms of the rent-to-buy agreement, you will lose 
            your money and be evicted like any other tenant.

            <em>Fake “government” modification programs:</em> 
            These scams claim to be affiliated with the government or 
            require that you pay high fees to benefit from government 
            modification programs. Remember that you do not have to pay 
            any fees to participate in government-approved programs. Some 
            frauds may even use words like “Federal” or “government-approved” 
            or acquire website names that make consumers think they are 
            associated with the government.

            <em>Refinance fraud:</em> The scam 
            artist offers to be an intermediary between you and your 
            mortgage lender to negotiate a loan modification. The scam 
            artist may even instruct you to make payments directly to 
            him or her, which the scammer will send to the lender. 
            However, the scam artist will not forward the payments 
            to your lender and you could still lose your home.

            <em>“Eliminate your debt” claims:</em> 
            Some companies may make false legal claims that you are 
            not required to repay your mortgage or that they know 
            of “secret laws” that can eliminate your debt. Do not 
            believe these claims.

            <em>Refinance scams:</em> You 
            are encouraged to sign “foreclosure rescue” loan documents 
            to refinance your loan. In reality, you have surrendered 
            ownership of your home because the loan documents are 
            actually deed transfer documents. You may falsely believe 
            that your home has been saved from foreclosure until you 
            receive an eviction notice months or even years later.

          Insist on a written contract that states exactly what work

          Don’t make a final payment or sign a final release until you

      With most home
      improvements, federal law gives you three business days to cancel
      without penalty. See the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule (p. 4). Of course,
      you would be liable for any benefit already received. State laws
      may also provide some protection. And remember, if you finance
      home improvements with a home equity loan (p. 16) and don’t make
      your payments, you could lose your home.

    <p>
      A lease is an agreement that outlines the obligations of the owner
      and the tenants of a house or apartment. It is a legally binding
      document that courts will generally uphold in legal proceedings,
      so it is important for you to know the exact terms of the lease
      agreement before you sign it. Before agreeing to lease an
      apartment to you, a landlord may review your credit report, so you
      may want to get a copy before you start your apartment search.
      Some things to look for in a lease:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Clauses that allow the landlord to change the terms of the
          lease after it is signed
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Requirements/responsibilities of the tenants to do routine
          repairs such as lawn maintenance, cleaning, or notification
          about needed repairs
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Restrictions that would prevent you from living normally or
          comfortably in the home
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Terms of the lease and any important dates such as when the
          rent is due or garbage pickup days
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Extra fees for parking spaces or storage, garbage collection,
          and pets
        </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Information regarding utility providers, how to arrange for
      service and whether the landlord or tenant is responsible for
      paying the bills (see Utilities, p. 52)
    </p>
    </li></ul>
    <p>
      Read the lease carefully and discuss anything you don’t understand
      or any issues you might have. All landlord responsibilities should
      be stated clearly. Always get a copy of the signed lease to keep
      in your records. Any clause or terms in the agreement affects ALL
      parties who sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check with the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) or your local
      consumer protection office (p. 112) to determine if your
      prospective landlord has any existing complaints from previous
      tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fair Housing Act protects tenants who lease or rent property.
      If you think your rights have been violated, you may write a
      letter to or call the HUD office nearest you (p. 102). You have 
      one year after the alleged violation to file a
      complaint with HUD, but you should file as soon as possible.
    </p>

      Each state has its own set of tenant rights, laws, and
      protections. For a state-by-state directory, visit

    <ol><li>
        <p>
            The best way to win over a prospective landlord is to be
            prepared by bringing a completed rental application with
            you; written references from previous landlords, employers,
            friends, and colleagues; and a current copy of your credit
            report.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Carefully review all of the important conditions of the
            tenancy before you sign.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            To avoid disputes or misunderstandings with your landlord,
            get everything in writing.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Ask about your privacy rights before you sign the lease.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Know your rights to live in a habitable rental unit— and
            don’t give them up.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Keep communication open with your landlord.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Purchase renters insurance to cover your valuables. See more
            information under Homeowners/Renters Insurance (p. 33).
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Make sure the security deposit refund procedures are spelled
            out in your lease or rental agreement.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Learn whether your building and neighborhood are safe, and
            what you can expect your landlord to do if they aren’t.
          </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Know when to fight an eviction notice and when to move. Unless
      you have the law and provable facts on your side, fighting an
      eviction notice is usually shortsighted.
