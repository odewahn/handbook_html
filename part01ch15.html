      What can you do about the growing pile of unwanted mail in your
      mailbox and unwelcome telemarketers on your phone? Actually,
      there’s a lot you can do:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Tell companies you do business with to remove your name from
          customer lists they rent or sell to others. Look for
          information on how to opt out of marketing lists on sales
          materials, order forms, and websites.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use the services provided by the Direct Marketing Association
          (p. 144) to remove your name from most national telemarketing,
          mail, and e-mail lists.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Call the credit reporting agencies’ notification system at
          1-888-567-8688. This will reduce the number of unsolicited
          credit and insurance offers you get. All three major credit
          bureaus participate in this program.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Under U.S. Postal Service (USPS) rules, it is illegal to send
          mail that looks like it is from a government agency when it
          isn’t. It is also illegal to send mail that looks like a bill
          when nothing was ordered, unless it clearly states that it is
          not a bill. Report violations of this rule to the USPS (p.
          108).

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35843877"><h1>National Do Not Call Registry</h1>
      
    <p>
      The federal government’s Do Not Call Registry allows you to
      restrict telemarketing calls permanently by registering your phone
      number at
      <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov">www.donotcall.gov</a> or by
      calling 1-888-382-1222. If you receive telemarketing calls after
      your number has been in the national registry for three months,
      you can file a complaint using the same web page and toll-free
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing your number on this national registry will stop most
      telemarketing calls, but not all of them. Calls that are still
      permitted include those from political organizations, charities,
      telephone surveyors, and some organizations with which you have a
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the standard has always been that telemarketers are
      not allowed to call cell phones. Cell phone numbers can also be
      added to the Do Not Call Registry (<a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/"/>), 
      but it is not necessary, since
      telemarketers are already forbidden to call them.
    </p>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35843912"><h1>Pre-recorded Messages</h1>
      
    <p>
      Pre-recorded sales calls or robocalls are illegal. Companies
      cannot transmit these messages to consumers who have not agreed,
      in writing, to accept such messages. Pre-recorded calls may only
      be made to residential telephone numbers in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Emergency calls needed to ensure your health and safety
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Non-commercial calls
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Calls that don’t include any unsolicited advertisements
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Calls by, or on behalf of, tax-exempt nonprofit organizations
        </p>

    <p>
      business relationship If you receive pre-recorded telemarketing
      calls but have not agreed to get them, file a complaint with the
      FTC at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov">www.donotcall.gov</a> or
      by calling 1-888-382-1222.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35843974"><h1>Telemarketing Sales Calls</h1>
      
    <p>
      An FTC rule defines what telemarketers can and cannot do when
      making a sales call. Callers must:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Provide the seller’s name
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Disclose that the call is a sales call
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Tell you exactly what they’re trying to sell
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Disclose the total cost and other terms of sale before you
          make any payment for goods or services
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Tell you if they don’t allow refunds, exchanges, or
          cancellations
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35844020"><h5>Opting Out</h5>
      
    <p>
      Tired of unwanted e-mail filling up your inbox? You can opt out of
      most unsolicited e-mail lists by going to the “unsubscribe”
      button, usually found at the bottom of the message. Some senders
      make the button difficult to find, so you may have to do some
      searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the Direct Marketing Association lets you opt out of
      receiving unsolicited commercial mail from many national companies
      for three years. You can register with this service for a small
      fee, but your registration only applies to organizations that use
      the association’s Mail Preference Service. To register, go to
      <a href="http://www.dmachoice.org">www.dmachoice.org</a>. If you
      would like to opt out of credit and insurance offers, you can call
      1-888-567-8688 or go online at
      <a href="http://www.optoutprescreen.com">www.optoutprescreen.com</a>,
      which is managed by the major credit reporting companies.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      If a prize is involved, the caller must give you the odds of
      winning, inform you that no purchase is necessary, and tell you
      how to get instructions for entering without buying anything. It’s
      illegal for telemarketers to:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Misrepresent what they’re offering
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Call before 8 am or after 9 pm
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Threaten, intimidate, or harass you, or call again if you 
          ask them not to
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      This FTC rule applies even when you receive a call
      from a telemarketer in another state or country. It also applies
      when you make a call to a company in another state or country in
      response to a mail solicitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule generally does not apply when you call to order from a
      catalog or in response to an ad on television or radio, or in a
      magazine or newspaper. It also does not apply to solicitations you
      receive by fax or e-mail. Beware that certain types of businesses,
      including nonprofit organizations, investment brokers and
      advisors, and banks and financial institutions, are exempt from
      the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you get a phone call from someone who says he or she is with
      your bank and/or credit company and the person asks you to provide
      or confirm any personal information:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Do NOT answer any questions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Hang up immediately.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Call your bank or credit company directly and describe what
          happened.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
