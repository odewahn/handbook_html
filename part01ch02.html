      Choosing a bank is a major decision, and there is no one right
      choice for all consumers. When you shop for a bank, you have to
      consider the actual products and services it provides as well as
      the location of branches, size of the bank, fees, and interest
      rates. Even if you conduct most transactions online or at
      automated teller machines, you want to choose a bank with quality
      customer service. Also, consider the variety of products that the
      bank provides; some banks may specialize in checking and savings
      accounts, while others are full-service banks, offering loans and
      CDs. You don’t have to maintain all of your accounts at one bank;
      you can have relationships with several to get the best rates on
      different services.

      <p>Beware of “shoulder surfers.” Be suspicious of anyone
        lurking around an ATM or watching over your shoulder
        while you use your card. Some thieves even put a device
        over the card slot of an ATM to read the magnetic strip and
        record your PIN; this is known as “skimming.” If you suspect
        criminal activity, walk away and use a different ATM.</p>
    </aside>
  <section data-type="sect1" id="atm_debit_cards"><h1>ATM/Debit Cards</h1>
    
    <p>
      With a debit card and personal identification number (PIN), you
      can use an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to withdraw cash, make
      deposits, or transfer funds between accounts. Some ATMs charge a
      fee if you are not a member of the ATM network or are making a
      transaction at a remote location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retail purchases can also be made with a debit card. You enter
      your PIN or sign for the purchase. Although a debit card looks
      like a credit card, the money for the purchase is transferred
      immediately from your bank account to the store’s account. When
      you use a debit card, federal law does not give you the right to
      stop payment; you must resolve problems directly with the seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you suspect your debit card has been lost or stolen, call the
      card issuer immediately. While federal law limits your liability
      for a lost or stolen credit card to $50, your liability for
      unauthorized use of your ATM or debit card can be much greater,
      depending on how quickly you report the loss.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          If you report a debit card missing before it is used, you are
          not responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Your liability is limited to $50 if you report the loss within
          two business days after you realize your debit card is missing
          and increases to $500 if you report the loss between two and
          60 days.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you have not reported an unauthorized use of a debit or ATM
          card within 60 days after your bank mails the statement
          documenting the unauthorized use, you could lose all of the
          money in your bank account as well as the unused portion of
          your line of credit established for overdrafts.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Check the policies of your card issuer; some offer more
    </p>
    <p>
      generous limits on a voluntary basis. Generally, banks may cover
      your overdrafts under their overdraft service and impose a fee on
      your account, or they may offer you a separate line of credit that
      includes interest charges. If your bank offers an overdraft
      service, you must opt into this service for most ATM and debit
      card transactions before the bank may impose any fees. Banks must
      disclose this option, the amount of the overdraft coverage fee,
      and the customer’s right to cancel this service. For more
      information, go to
      <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov">www.consumerfinance.gov</a>.

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35833466"><h5>Before You Swipe Your Debit Card</h5>
      
    <p>
      Although both credit cards and debit cards are easy ways to pay
      for your purchases, debit cards have some different levels of
      consumer protection and potential for consumer fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/pdf5131_img_10.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Debit cards are directly connected to your bank account, so when
      you swipe your card, make sure you have the money in your account
      to pay immediately. If you don’t have enough money in your
      account, your bank may “lend” you the money and pay the overage.
      However, it may charge you up to $35 for this courtesy, even if
      the dollar amount the bank covered was small. Determine whether
      you can opt out of overdraft protection. Some banks also charge
      you a monthly fee for making purchases with your debit card. Since
      new fees can be added without warning, be sure to check
      periodically for changes to your account fees for using your debit
      card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debit cards don’t offer as much protection against fraudulent use
      or if your card is lost or stolen. Also, if you need to dispute a
      purchase, you are in a weaker position because the merchant
      already has the money and will only return it if you win the
      dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, when you use your debit card to make reservations for hotels
      or rental cars, a hold is placed on your card (and your checking
      account), which can affect your other pending transactions. Even
      if the hold is removed, it may take as long as a week until the
      funds are available to you again.

  <section data-type="sect1" id="id35833513"><h1>Savings And Checking</h1>
    
    <p>
      When it comes to finding a safe place to put your money, 
      there are a lot of options. Savings accounts, checking 
      accounts, certificates of deposit (CD), and money market 
      accounts are popular choices. Each has different rules 
      and benefits that fit different needs. The bank must 
      provide you with the account terms and conditions when 
      you open your account. When choosing the one that is 
      right for you, consider:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Minimum deposit requirements.</strong>
      Some accounts can only be set up with a minimum dollar amount. 
      If your account goes below the minimum, the bank may not pay 
      you interest on the money you deposited and you may be 
      charged extra fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Limits on withdrawals</strong>. Can you
      take money out whenever you want? Are there any penalties for doing so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interest</strong>. How much
      (if anything) is paid and when? Daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly? 
      To compare rates offered by local and national financial institutions,
      visit <a href="http://www.bankrate.com">www.bankrate.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deposit insurance</strong>. Make sure
      your bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
      (FDIC). This agency protects the money in your checking and savings 
      accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and Individual 
      Retirement Accounts (IRAs) up to $250,000. For more 
      information, see page 106 or visit
      <a href="http://www.fdic.gov">www.fdic.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Credit unions</strong>. A credit union
      is a nonprofit, cooperative financial institution owned and run 
      by its members. Like the FDIC does for banks, the National Credit 
      Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insures a person’s savings up 
      to $250,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Convenience</strong>. How easy is it to
      put money in and take it out? Are there branches or ATMs close to 
      where you work and live? Can you bank by phone or Internet?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are considering a checking account or another type 
      of account with check-writing privileges, add these
      items to your list of things to think about:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Number of checks</strong>. Is there a
      maximum number of checks you can write per month without incurring 
      a charge?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check fees</strong>. Is there a monthly
      fee for the account or a charge for each check you write?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Holds on checks.</strong>Is
      there a waiting period for checks to clear before you can withdraw 
      the money from your account?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Overdrafts</strong>. If you write a
      check for more money than you have in your account, what happens? 
      You may be able to link your checking account to a savings account
      to protect yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Debit card fees</strong>. Are there fees
      for using your debit card?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Account fees.</strong> Banks can charge
      fees on your checking or savings account to cover things like maintenance, 
      withdrawals, or minimum balance rules. However, the bank must inform you 
      of the fees up front as part of your account agreement and notify you 
      when changes occur. Practices vary from bank to bank, but each must inform 
      you of the fee change on your statement, in a separate letter, or in a 
      pamphlet. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/findananswer/can-a-bank-really.cfm">www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/findananswer/can-a-bank-really.cfm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bounced checks</strong>. It’s
      your responsibility to have sufficient funds in your account to 
      cover the checks you write. If you try to cash a check, withdraw money, or
      use your debit card for an amount greater than the amount 
      of money in your account, you can face a bounced check 
      or overdraft fee. Your bank may pay for the item, but 
      charge you a fee or deny the purchase and still charge 
      you a fee. In addition, the business to which you wrote 
      the check may charge you an additional returned check 
      fee. Bounced checks can also blemish your credit
      record, so you may want to talk to your bank about overdraft
      protection. For more information, visit
      <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bounce">www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bounce</a>.

  </section>
  <section data-type="sect1" id="unsolicited_checks_and_credit_offers"><h1>Unsolicited Checks and Credit Offers</h1>
    
    <p>
      If you cash an unsolicited check, you could be agreeing to pay for
      products or services you don’t want or need. In addition, those
      “guarantees” for credit cards or loans, without consideration of
      credit history, are probably a scam. Legitimate lenders never
      guarantee credit. For more information on how to identify
      fraudulent solicitations, visit
      <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35833683"><h5>Phishing Scams</h5>
      
    <p>
      “Phishing” is the use of fraudulent e-mail designed to steal
      identities as well as vital personal information such as credit
      card numbers, bank account PINs, and passwords. Phishing e-mails
      often ask you to verify this type of information. Scammers also go
      “SMishing,” or phishing using text messages, by asking you to
      verify or confirm sensitive information. Legitimate companies
      never ask for your password or account number via e-mail. If
      you’re not sure whether the e-mail is trustworthy, call the
      company directly and forward the email to <em data-type="email">spam@uce.gov</em>. If you
      believe you’ve received a phishing e-mail, don’t hit reply! The
      e-mail may even threaten to disable your account. Don’t believe
      it!
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Legitimate offers of credit often come in the form of “convenience
      checks,” which credit card companies enclose with your monthly
      statement. However, convenience checks may carry higher fees, a
      higher interest rate, and other restrictions. If you don’t want
      the checks, be sure to shred them to protect yourself from
      “dumpster divers” and identity thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch out for checks from someone in a foreign country claiming
      that you won a lottery, for an investment, or to pay for an item
      you sold online. This could be a scam. Even if you deposit the
      check, the check may not be legal. Don’t rely on money from a
      check, especially foreign or unsolicited, until your bank says the
      check has cleared or if you know and trust the person who sent it
      to you.
    </p>

  <section data-type="sect1" id="prepaid_cards"><h1>Prepaid Cards</h1>
    
    <p>
      Prepaid cards, also known as prepaid debit, stored value, or gift
      cards, are convenient ways to pay for your purchases. Banks and
      retailers issue them to offer consumers a way to make payments and
      conduct other financial transactions. You do not need to have a
      bank account or a credit history to use a prepaid card. There are
      plenty of situations where a prepaid card might be the most
      convenient choice, but be sure you understand the key terms and
      conditions BEFORE you buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many cards carry protections similar to credit and debit cards. To
      obtain these benefits, you must follow the instructions for
      registering and activating your card. Be sure to record your card
      information, including the customer service telephone number
      listed on the back of the card in a separate place, so you can get
      a replacement if yours is lost or stolen. Some prepaid card
      issuers may charge fees for card activation, maintenance, and cash
      withdrawals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a problem with a prepaid card, first contact the
      customer service number. If the problem still isn’t resolved, you
      may want to file a complaint with the proper authorities:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          For cards issued by retailers, contact the FTC (p. 107). You
          may also file a complaint with your local consumer protection
          office (p. 112).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          For cards issued by national banks, contact the Office of the
          Comptroller of the Currency (p. 105).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          For cards issued by state banks, contact the FDIC (p. 106) or 
          state banking authority (p. 126). For more information, visit

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35833785"><h2>Government Benefits on Prepaid Cards</h2>
      
    <p>
      Many government agencies deliver financial benefits using prepaid
      cards. All Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
      benefits are paid via electronic benefit cards. Beginning in March
      2013, all Social Security benefits must be paid via direct deposit
