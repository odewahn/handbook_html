      Whether you are buying or leasing a vehicle, these tips will help
      you get the best deal and avoid problems:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Decide what kind of vehicle best suits your needs and budget.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check out the seller. For car dealers, check with your state
          or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and Better
          Business Bureau (p. 67). If you’re buying from an individual,
          check the title to make sure you’re dealing with the vehicle’s
          owner.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Take a test drive. Drive at different speeds and check for
          smooth right and left turns. On a straight stretch, make sure
          the vehicle doesn’t pull to one side.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Handle trade-ins and financing separately from your purchase
          to get the best deal on each. Get a written price quote before
          you talk about a trade-in or dealer financing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Shop in advance and compare financing options at your credit
          union, bank, or finance company. Look at the total finance
          charges and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), not just the
          monthly payment.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Read and understand every document you are asked to sign.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t take possession of the car until all paperwork is final.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Choose an auto insurance policy that is right for you (p. 32).
        </p>
      </li></ul>

      Do your research first and compare vehicles. Four key resources
      that offer vehicle performance, service, and safety information
      are: <em>Consumer
      Reports</em> (<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org"/>),
      <em>Motor
        Trend</em> (<a href="http://www.motortrend.com"/>),
      <em>Car and
        Driver</em> (<a href="http://www.caranddriver.com"/>),
      and Edmunds automotive books and network (<a href="http://www.edmunds.com"/>).
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
      Research the dealer’s price for the car and options. It’s easier
      to get the best price when you know what the dealer paid for a
      vehicle. The dealer invoice price is available on a number of
      websites and in printed pricing guides. <em>Consumer
      Reports</em> offers the wholesale price; this figure factors
      in dealer incentives from a manufacturer and is a more accurate
      estimate of what a dealer is paying for a vehicle.
    </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out whether the manufacturer is offering rebates that
          will lower the cost. For more information, visit
          <a href="http://www.autopedia.com/html/Rebate.html">www.autopedia.com/html/Rebate.html</a>.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get price quotes from several dealers. Find out if the amounts
          quoted are the prices before or after rebates are deducted.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Avoid low-value extras such as credit insurance, extended
          warranties, auto club memberships, rustproofing, and
          upholstery finishes. You do not have to purchase credit
          insurance to get a loan. See Service Contracts and Extended
          Warranties (p. 2).

          Hybrid cars are popular among consumers interested in fuel
          economy and reducing their negative impact on the environment.
          These cars combine the benefits of gasoline engines and
          electric motors and can be configured to achieve different
          objectives, such as improved fuel economy, increased power, or
          additional auxiliary power. For more information about

      These guides are usually available at local libraries.
    </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Research the vehicle’s history. Ask the seller for details
          concerning past owners, use, and maintenance. Next, find out
          whether the car has been damaged in a flood, involved in a
          crash, been labeled a “lemon,” or had its odometer rolled
          back.

        <p>
          Have your mechanic inspect the car. Talk to the seller and
          agree in advance that you’ll pay for the examination if the
          car passes inspection, but the seller will pay if significant
          problems are discovered. A qualified mechanic should check the
          vehicle’s frame, tires, air bags, and undercarriage as well as
          the engine.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="dealer_versus_private-party_purchases"><h1>Dealer Versus Private-party Purchases</h1>
      
    <p>
      In general, buying a used car from a dealer is a safer option
      because you are dealing with an institution, which means you are
      better protected by law. The FTC requires dealers to post a
      Buyer’s Guide in the window of each used car or truck on their
      lot. This guide specifies whether the vehicle is being sold “as
      is” (in the vehicle’s current condition, without a warranty) or
      with a warranty, and what percentage of repair costs a dealer will
      pay under the warranty. Keep in mind that private sellers
      generally have less responsibility than dealers do for defects or
      other problems. FTC rules do not apply to private-party sales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expect to pay higher prices at a dealer than if you buy from an
      individual. Many dealers inspect their cars and provide an
      inspection report with each one. However, this is no substitute
      for your own inspection. Some dealers provide limited warranties,
      and most sell extended warranties. Watch out for dealer warranties
      that are “power train” warranties only, and not “bumper-tobumper,”
      full-coverage warranties. It’s best to compare warranties that are
      available from other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some dealers sell “certified” cars. This generally means that the
      cars have had a more thorough inspection and come with a limited
      warranty. Prices for certified cars are generally higher. Be sure
      to get a list of what was inspected and what is covered under the
      warranty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purchasing a car from a private seller may save you money, but
      there are risks. The car could be stolen, damaged, or still under
      a finance agreement. If a private seller lies to you about the 
      condition of the vehicle, you may sue the individual if you have 
      evidence and you can find him or her. An individual is very unlikely 
      to provide a written warranty.

    <p>
      Crash tests can help you determine how well a vehicle will protect
      you in a crash. These organizations perform crash tests and rate
      vehicles:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>The National Highway Traffic Safety
          Administration.</strong> Each year, NHTSA (<a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov"/>)
          crashes vehicles head-on into a wall
          and bashes them broadside to test their ability to protect
          their occupants. NHTSA focuses on evaluating vehicle
          restraints such as air bags and safety belts.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>The Insurance Institute for Highway
          Safety.</strong> A different
          test by the IIHS (<a href="http://www.hwysafety.org"/>) uses
          offset-frontal car crashes to assess the protection a
          vehicle’s structure provides.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Consumer Reports.</strong> The annual
          auto issue of Consumer Reports
          (<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org"/>) rates vehicles in terms of
          overall safety. Its safety score combines crash test results
          with a vehicle’s accident-avoidance factors— emergency
          handling, braking, acceleration, and even driver comfort.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System.</strong> 
          The NMVTIS (<a href="http://www.vehiclehistory.gov"/>) 
          provides information about a vehicle’s history and condition, 
          history, and, in some cases, theft.
    </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      To find out whether a manufacturer has recalled a car for safety
      defects, contact NHTSA (p. 104). If a vehicle has been recalled,
      ask the dealer for proof that the defect has been
      repaired. Used vehicles should also have a current safety
      inspection sticker if your state requires one.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="financing"><h1>Financing</h1>
      
    <p>
      Most car buyers today need some form of financing to purchase a
      new vehicle. Many use direct lending, that is, a loan from a
      finance company, bank, or credit union. In direct lending, a buyer
      agrees to pay the amount financed, plus an agreed-upon finance
      charge, over a specified period. Once a buyer and a vehicle
      dealership enter into a contract to purchase a vehicle, the buyer
      uses the loan proceeds from the direct lender to pay the
      dealership for the vehicle.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35834412"><h5>Long-term Car Loans</h5>
      
    <p>
      Some car dealers and banks offer loans that allow you to finance
      your car for longer periods than a traditional auto loan (more
      than six years). Before you decide on the length of your auto
      loan, weigh the pros and cons. Long-term loans can make your
      monthly payments smaller and allow you to refinance the loan after
      a few years, to reduce the length of the loan. Remember, however,
      that these loans can cost more over the life of the loan because
      you are paying interest for a longer period. Also, as the car
      depreciates, you may end up owing more on your loan than the value
      of the car. This is called negative equity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another common form is dealership financing, which offers
      convenience, financing options, and sometimes special,
      manufacturer-sponsored, low-rate deals. Before you make a
      financing decision, it’s important to do your research:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Decide in advance how much you can afford to spend and stick
          to your limit.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get a copy of your credit report and correct any errors before
          applying for a loan.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check buying guides to identify price ranges and best available deals.
        </p>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="leasing"><h1>Leasing</h1>
      
    <p>
      When you lease, you pay to drive someone else’s vehicle. Monthly
      payments for a lease may be lower than loan payments, but at the
      end of the lease, you do not own or have any equity in the car. To
      get the best deal, follow this advice in addition to the general
      suggestions for buying a car (p. 8):
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          To help you compare leasing versus owning, the Consumer
          Leasing Act requires leasing companies to give you information
          on monthly payments and other charges. Check out
          <a href="http://www.leaseguide.com">www.leaseguide.com</a> and
          <a href="http://www.leasecompare.com">www.leasecompare.com</a>
          for more information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Consider using an independent agent rather than the dealer;
          you might find a better deal. Most financial institutions that
          offer auto financing also offer leasing options.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for details on wear and tear standards. Dings that you
          regard as normal wear and tear could be billed as significant
          damage at the end of your lease.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out how many miles you can drive in a year. Most leases
          allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Expect a charge of 10 to
          25 cents for each additional mile.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check the manufacturer’s warranty; it should cover the entire
          lease term and the number of miles you are likely to drive.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask the dealer what happens if you give up the car before the
          end of your lease. There may be extra fees for doing so.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask what happens if the car is involved in an accident.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get all of the terms in writing. Everything included with the
          car should be listed on the lease to avoid your being charged
          for “missing” equipment later.
        </p>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="recalls"><h1> Recalls, “Lemon” Laws, And Secret Warranties</h1>
      
    <p>
      Sometimes a manufacturer makes a design or production mistake on a
      motor vehicle. A service bulletin notifies the dealer of the
      problem and how to resolve it. Because these free repairs are not
      publicized, they are called “secret warranties.” The National
      Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains a database of
      service bulletins filed by manufacturers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a problem with a vehicle that is a safety hazard,
      check whether the manufacturer has recalled your vehicle. You can
      find information about service bulletins, recalls, and other
      safety defects at www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/
      rec<a href="http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/recalls/recallsearch.cfm">alls/recallsearch.cfm
      or call DOT’s Vehicle Safety</a>Hotline at 1-800-424-9393. You
      should report hazards that aren’t listed to your dealer, the
      manufacturer of the vehicle (p. 64), and NHTSA at
      <a href="http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq">www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq</a>.
      If a safety-related defect exists, the maker must fix it at no
      cost to you—even if your warranty has expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a vehicle with a unique problem that just never seems
      to get fixed, you may have a “lemon.” Some states have laws
      concerning “lemons” that require a refund or replacement if a
      problem is not fixed within a reasonable number of tries. These
      laws might also go into effect if you haven’t been able to use
      your vehicle for a certain number of days. Contact your state or
      local consumer protection office (p. 112) to learn whether you
      have such protections and what steps you must take to get your
      problem solved. If you believe your car is a “lemon”:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Give the dealer a list of the problems every time you bring it
          in for repairs.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get and keep copies of the repair orders listing the problems,
          the work done, and the dates the car was in the shop.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact the manufacturer, as well as the dealer, to report the
          problem. Check your owner’s manual or the directory for the
          auto manufacturer (p. 64).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      The Center for Auto Safety (p. 109) gathers information and
      complaints concerning safety defects, recalls, service bulletins,
      and state “lemon” laws.

    <p>
      Before renting a car:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Ask what the total cost will be after all fees are included.
          There may be an airport surcharge or fees for drop-off,
          insurance, fuel, mileage, taxes, additional-drivers,
          underage-driver, and equipment rental (for items such as ski
          racks and car seats). See drip pricing on p. 2.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether the rental company checks the driving records of
          customers when they arrive at the counter. If so, you could be
          rejected, even if you have a confirmed reservation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check in advance to be sure you aren’t duplicating insurance
          coverage. If you’re traveling on business, your employer may
          have insurance that covers accidental damage to the vehicle.
          You might also have coverage through your personal auto
          insurance (p. 32), a motor club membership, or the credit card
          you use to reserve the rental.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Carefully inspect the vehicle and its tires before renting and
          when you return it. Try to return the car during regular hours
          so you and the rental staff can look at the car together to
          verify that you didn’t damage it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check refueling policies and charges.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Pay with a credit card rather than a debit card, to avoid
          holds on the funds in your checking account. See “Before You
          Swipe Your Debit Card” (p. 6).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask the rental company whether a deposit is required. If so,
          ask for a clear explanation of the deposit refund policies and
          procedures.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <p>
      Whenever you take a car to the repair shop:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
       <p>
      Choose a reliable repair shop. Family, friends, or an
      independent consumer-rating organization should be able to help
      you. Look for shops that display various certifications that are
      current. You should also check out the shop’s record with your
      state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) or the Better
      Business Bureau (p. 67).
        </p>
        <p>
          Describe the symptoms. Don’t try to diagnose the problem.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make it clear that work cannot begin until you have an
          estimate (in writing, preferably) and you give your okay.
          Never sign a blank repair order. If the problem can’t be
          diagnosed on the spot, insist that the shop contact you for
          authorization once it has found the trouble.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask the shop to return the old parts to you.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Follow the warranty instructions if a repair is covered under
          warranty.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get all repair warranties in writing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep copies of all paperwork.
        </p>

      Some states, cities, and
      counties have special laws that deal with auto repairs. For
      information on the laws in your state, contact your state or
      local consumer protection office (p. 112). A consumer guide to
      auto repair is available at

    <p>
      When you borrow money to buy a car or truck, the lender can take
      your vehicle back if you miss a payment or in some other way
      violate the contract. You should also be aware that the lender:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Can repossess with cause without advance notice
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Can insist you pay off the entire loan balance to get the
          repossessed vehicle back
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Can sell the vehicle at auction
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Might be able to sue you for the difference between the
          vehicle’s auction price and what you owe
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cannot break into your home or physically threaten someone while taking the vehicle
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      If you know you’re going to be
      late with a payment, talk to the lender. If you and the lender
      reach an agreement, be sure to get the agreement in writing.
      Contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) to
      find out whether your state gives you any additional rights.
