        <p>
          Many federal agencies have enforcement and/or 
          complaint-handling duties for products and services 
          used by the general public. Others act for the benefit 
          of the public, but do not resolve individual consumer 
          problems. Agencies also create printed publications, and 
          websites that may be helpful when making purchase 
          decisions or dealing with consumer problems. Some agencies 
          provide timely information to citizens through profile pages 
          and videos on social media outlets, blogs, text messages, 
          and news feeds. If you need help in deciding which federal 
          agency to contact, check the index at the end of this book 
          or call 1-800-333-4636.
