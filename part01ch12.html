      If you have a financial goal in mind, such as saving for
      retirement, paying for college, or buying a new house, then you
      may decide to invest your money to earn enough to fund your goals.
      Before you invest, do some homework. What is your tolerance for
      risk? What do you want to invest in? Stocks? Bonds? Mutual funds?
      Do you want to open an IRA or buy an annuity? Does your employer
      offer a 401(k)? Remember, every investment involves some degree of
      risk. Most securities are not insured by the federal government if
      they lose money or fail, even if you purchase them through a bank
      or credit union that offers federally insured savings accounts.
      Make sure you have answers to all of these questions before you
      invest:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
        <strong>How quickly can you get your money back?</strong>
      Stocks, bonds, and shares in mutual funds usually can be sold at
      any time, but there is no guarantee you will get back all the
      money you paid for them. Other investments, such as limited
      partnerships, certificates of deposit (CDs), or IRAs, often
      restrict your ability to cash out your holdings.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>What can you expect to earn on your money?</strong>
      While bonds generally promise a fixed return, earnings on most
      other securities go up and down with market changes. Keep in mind
      that just because an investment has done well in the past, there
      is no guarantee it will do well in the future.
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What type of earnings can you
          expect?</strong> Will you get income in the form of
          interest, dividends, or rent? Some investments, such as stocks
          and real estate, have the potential for earnings and growth in
          value. What is the potential for earnings over time?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>How much risk is involved?</strong>
          With any investment, there is always the risk that you won’t
          get your money back or the earnings promised. There is usually
          a trade-off between risk and reward—the higher the potential
          return, the greater the risk. The federal government insures
          bank savings accounts and backs up U.S. Treasury securities
          (including savings bonds). See FDIC on page 106 and the chart
          on page 7 for regulatory information. Other investment options
          are not protected.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Are your investments
          diversified?</strong> Some investments perform better than
          others in certain situations. For example, when interest rates
          go up, bond prices tend to go down. One industry may struggle
          while another prospers. Putting your money in a variety of
          investment options can help to reduce your risk.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Are there any tax advantages to a
          particular investment?</strong> U.S. Savings Bonds are exempt
          from state and local taxes. Municipal bonds are exempt from
          federal income tax and, sometimes, state income tax as well.
          Tax-deferred investments for special goals, such as paying for
          college and retirement, are available that let you postpone or
          even avoid paying income taxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deceptive pitches for investments often misrepresent or leave 
          out facts to promote fantastic profits with little risk. No 
          investment is risk-free, and a high rate of return means 
          greater risk. Before investing, get written information such 
          as a prospectus or annual report. Beware if a salesperson:
        </p>

    <p>
      Stocks can be bought and sold with a mouse click from a wide range
      of online brokers, often with low transaction fees. However, the
      price of some stocks can instantly go from high to low. Online
      trading is quick and easy, but online investing requires research
      and takes time. Before you trade, ask questions and learn how to
      limit losses in this fast-moving marketplace by:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Knowing what you’re buying
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Understanding why you’re buying or selling
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Being aware of how quickly trading changes during fast markets
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Like other purchases, you should set a price limit, to
      avoid buying or selling at prices above or lower than you wanted.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35841045"><h1>Financial Brokers and Advisors</h1>
      
    <p>
      When selecting a broker or investment advisor, research the
      person’s education and professional history as well as the firm
      the person works for. Ask:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
      Has the person worked with others who have circumstances similar
      to yours?
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Is the person licensed in your state? Your state securities
          regulator (p. 134) lists individuals and firms that are
          registered in your state. Ask whether the regulatory office
          has any other background information. You can find out how to
          reach your state securities regulator by visiting
          <a href="http://www.nasaa.org">www.nasaa.org</a>.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Has the person had any run-ins with regulators or received
          serious complaints from investors? Call your local state
          securities regulator or the SEC (p. 108). You can also check
          out
          <a href="http://www.finra.org/brokercheck">www.finra.org/brokercheck</a> to
          find licensing, employment, and disciplinary information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How is the person paid? Is it an hourly rate, a flat fee, or a
          commission that depends on the investments you make? Does the
          person get a bonus from his or her firm for selling you a
          particular product?
        </p>
      </li><li>

    <p>
      Many financial experts recommend buying gold as part of a balanced
      portfolio. Some suggest buying only a small amount because values
      can fluctuate; others recommend larger investments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways to invest in precious metals; common
      ones include bullion, certificates, and coins. Most people depend
      on an investment advisor or company to help them choose. Make sure
      the person or company you choose is licensed with your state
      securities administrator (p. 134). If you’re considering investing
      in gold, check the U.S. Mint website at
      <a href="http://www.usmint.gov">www.usmint.gov</a>. Before you
      purchase coins or coin-related products, research the seller with
      your state consumer protection office (p. 112) or Better Business
      Bureau (p. 67).

      Commodity futures are an agreement to buy or sell a specific
      quantity of metals, grains, or other foods. Anyone who trades or

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35841193"><h1>Retirement Planning</h1>
      
    <p>
      Part of smart investing is planning for retirement. The average
      American spends 20 years in retirement, but fewer than half of
      Americans calculate how much they need to save for their
      retirement years. Regardless of your age, it’s never too early or
      too late to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three major components of a retirement portfolio are generally
      benefits from pensions, savings and investments, and Social
      Security.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are still working and your employer offers a plan, find out
      how it works. If your employer has a 401(k) plan and offers to put
      some money in if you do (called a match), this should be the first
      place where you save. Make sure you understand how a job change
      might affect your employer-based retirement plan and what your
      options are for saving that money. If you switch jobs before you
      are fully vested, you may lose a significant amount of money.

      As you approach retirement, there are many factors to consider.
      Experts advise that you will need about 80% of your pre-retirement
      income in your retirement years. The exact amount, of course,
      depends on your individual needs (see Elder Care, p. 25). For
      example:
