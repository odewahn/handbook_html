      <p>
        Companies that manufacture similar products or offer 
        similar services often belong to an industry association. 
        These associations help resolve problems between their 
        member companies and consumers. Most also provide 
        consumer information through publications and websites.
      </p>
        <p>
          If you have a problem with a company and cannot resolve 
          it by working directly with that firm, ask whether the 
          company is a member of an association. Then check this 
          section to see whether the association is listed. If the 
          association is not included here, your local library has 
          reference materials to help you find the appropriate contact.
