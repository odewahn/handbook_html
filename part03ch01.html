    <p>
      Disasters can strike in many forms—fires, floods, hurricanes,
      tornadoes, and even national emergencies. Protecting yourself,
      your family, your pets, and your home or your business requires
      advance planning. It is equally important to know where to turn
      for help and information. You may even be eligible for government
      assistance.

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35846032"><h5>Services And Resources For Consumers With Disabilities</h5>
      
    <p>
      <strong>Relay Services:</strong> Telecommunications 
      relay services link telephone conversations
      between individuals who use standard voice telephones and those
      who use text telephones (TTYs). Calls may be made from either type
      of telephone to the other type through the relay service.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Local Relay Services</strong>:
      States provide relay services for local and long-distance 
      calls. Consult your local telephone directory for information 
      on use, fees (if any), services, and dialing instructions 
      for that area.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Federal Relay
      Service</strong>: The FRS, a program of the U.S. 
      General Services Administration (GSA), provides access to 
      TTY users who wish to conduct official business nationwide 
      with and within the federal government. The toll-free 
      number is 1-866-377-8642. For more information on relay 
      communications or to obtain a brochure on using the FRS, 
      call 1-800-877-0996.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Services</strong>: Consumers who
      are deaf or hard of hearing, or who have speech impairment and use a TTY,
      may receive operator and directory assistance for calls by
      calling 1-800-855-1155. Check the introductory pages of your
      local telephone directory for additional TTY services.

      In case of a disaster, make certain that you have your ID, cash, debit

      Today’s military families face many common consumer challenges as
      well as the additional stress associated with frequent separation.
      To ease such difficulties, Family Centers, along with the other
      programs described below, provide help and support for military families.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>U.S. Military Family Centers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Located on most military installations, Family Centers provide
      information, life skills education, and support services to
      military members and their families. One key function of the
      Family Center is to link customers with appropriate services
      available in the local community and/or through state and federal
      assistance programs such as those related to health and human
      services, school systems, employment assistance, law enforcement,
      and recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot locate a Family Center, contact your respective
      military branch’s headquarters office listed below. The
      designation “DSN,” preceding some of the phone numbers, refers to
      the military phone system and does not apply to the civilian
      sector.

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35846485"><h5>Predatory Lending Restrictions</h5>
      
    <p>
      As of October 1, 2007, the Talent-Nelson Amendment to the John
      Warner National Defense Authorization Act allows the Department of
      Defense to regulate the terms of payday loans, vehicle title
      loans, and tax refund loans to active-duty service members and
      their dependents. These three products have high interest rates,
      coupled with short payback terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule for service members and their dependents limits the
      Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) on these loans to 36%. All
      fees and charges should be included in calculating the rate. The
      rule also prohibits contracts requiring the use of a check or
      access to a bank account, mandatory arbitration, or unreasonable
      legal notice. Any credit agreement subject to this regulation that
      fails to comply with the regulation is void and cannot be
      enforced. The rule further provides that a creditor or assignee
      that knowingly violates the regulation shall be subject to certain
      criminal penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Defense strongly encourages service members and
      their families to choose alternatives that specifically help
      resolve financial crises, rebuild credit ratings, and establish
      savings for emergencies. Payday loans, vehicle title loans, and
      tax refund loans can propel an already overextended borrower into
      a deeper spiral of debt.

      The National Resource Directory provides wounded, ill, and injured
      service members; veterans; their families; and those who support
      them, with a web-based “yellow book.” It has information on, and
      access to, the full range of medical and non-medical services and
      resources needed to achieve their personal and professional goals
      across the transitions from recovery to rehabilitation to
      community reintegration. The National Resource Directory, an
      online partnership of the departments of Defense, Labor, and
      Veterans Affairs, provides links to the services and resources of
      federal, state, and local government agencies; veterans’ service,
      nonprofit, community-based, and philanthropic organizations;
      professional associations; and academic institutions.
