    <p>
      There are plenty of resources available to help you make health
      care decisions. Be wary of websites sponsored by companies that
      are trying to sell you a particular treatment. It’s better to
      contact reputable associations or visit sites run by government
      agencies and recognized organizations such as the Mayo Clinic or
      the American Medical Association (AMA). This information should
      complement, not replace, what you receive from a doctor. Here are
      some sites that are generally recognized as reliable information
      sources:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          HealthFinder.gov and MedlinePlus (<a href="http://www.medlineplus.gov"/>)

          programs, and organizations.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Mayo Clinic (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com"/>)
          offers an index of diseases and much more.

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35838041"><h1>Choosing A Doctor</h1>
      
    <p>
      When searching for a primary care doctor, dentist, specialist, or
      other health care professional:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Find out whether the health care professional is licensed in
          your state. A state or local occupational and professional
          licensing board will be able to give you this information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Research whether the health care professional is
          board-certified in the appropriate specialty. Visit 
          <a href="http:ama-assn.org">www.ama-assn.org</a> and
          <a href="http://www.abms.org">www.abms.org</a> for more
          information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Ask how often the health care professional has done the procedure
      you need or has treated your condition. You may be able to find
      some of this information on the Internet. For example, the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the success rates
      and number of procedures performed by fertility clinics at
      <a href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</a>. Some states also
      collect and post data on the success of heart-bypass surgery.
    </p>
    </li><li>
    <p>
      Check whether there have been any complaints or disciplinary
      actions taken against the provider you are researching. Visit
      <a href="http://www.docboard.org">www.docboard.org</a> for more
      information. There are also pay-for-use sites with similar
      information, including
      <a href="http://www.Docinfo.org">www.docinfo.org</a> and
      <a href="http://www.mdnationwide.org">www.mdnationwide.org</a>.
      Visit
      <a href="http://www.healthfinder.gov">www.healthfinder.gov</a> and
      <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/consumer">www.ahrq.gov/consumer</a>
      for more advice on identifying providers.
    </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out what doctors participate in your health insurance
          plan. If you are having surgery, check that all providers
          (radiologists, anesthesiologists) are also covered by your
          plan, to avoid surprise bills.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
        <p>
          Consider these questions regarding your health care provider
          and his or her practice:
        </p>
    <ul><li>
    <p>
      Does the doctor participate in your insurance plan?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Is the office in an area that you can get to easily or does it
      have hours during times when you can make an appointment?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Does the doctor have privileges at the hospital you prefer?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Do you get along well with the doctor? Do you feel that you
      communicate well with each other and that he or she listens to
      your concerns and explains diagnoses and benefits of new
      treatments and prescriptions clearly?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      What is the doctor’s cancelation policy?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Will you have to pay for the visit if you cancel your appointment?
    </p>
      </li></ul>

      <p>Medical identity theft can occur when someone steals 
        your personal information number to obtain medical 
        care, buy medication, or submit fake claims to your 
        insurer or Medicare in your name. To prevent medical 
        identity theft, you can:</p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
          Guard your Social Security, Medicare, and health 
          insurance identification numbers. Only give your 
          number to your physician or other approved health 
          care providers.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Review your explanation of benefits or Medicare 
            Summary Notice to make sure that the claims match 
            the services you received. Report questionable 
            charges to your health insurance provider or Medicare.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Request and carefully review a copy of your medical 
            records for inaccuracies and conditions that you don’t 
            have.
          </p>
        </li></ul>
      <p>
        If you believe you have been a victim of medical identity 
        theft, file a complaint with the FTC at 1-877- 438-4338 or 
        <a href="http://ftccomplaintassistant.gov">http://ftccomplaintassistant.gov</a> and your health insurance

          Your pharmacist oversees an important part of your 
          health care by providing the medications prescribed 
          by other health care professionals. It’s important that 
          you are proactive and communicate honestly with 
          your pharmacist. Topics you should discuss with your 
          pharmacist include:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              What other medications you take

    <p>
      When you are sick, you may not know the best place to go for
      medical care. In non-emergency situations, your first choice
      should be your primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP knows your
      medical history and treats common ailments. Urgent care is best
      when you need medical attention for a non-life threatening illness
      quickly or after regular hours. Go to the emergency room if your
      illness is serious or life-threatening, such as:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Choking
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Stopped breathing
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Head injury with passing out, fainting, or confusion
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Injury to neck or spine, especially if there is loss of
          feeling or inability to move
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Electric shock or lightning strike
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Severe burn
        </p>
      </li><li>

    <p>
      Remember to finish your entire prescription, since some illnesses
      require treatment to continue past the time when symptoms go away.
      Make certain that your pharmacy has your current health and
      prescription insurance on record so you get the best price
      possible. If you have difficulty paying for your medications,
      contact the manufacturer; some pharmaceutical companies have
      patient assistance programs to help you afford your medication.
    </p>
    <p>
      An increasing number of consumers are replacing a trip to the
      pharmacy with a visit to the Internet. While there are online
      pharmacies that provide legitimate prescription services, there
      are also some questionable sites that make buying medicines online
      risky. Do business only with a licensed U.S. pharmacy. Check with
      the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy to determine
      whether the site is licensed and in good standing. Visit
      <a href="http://www.nabp.net">www.nabp.net</a> or call
      847-391-4406.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you suspect a site is not a licensed pharmacy, report it and
      any complaints to the Food and Drug Administration (p. 100) at

      <section data-type="sect1" id="id35838636"><h1>Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage</h1>
        
    <p>
      Medicare offers prescription drug coverage to help senior citizens
      and others who need medical assistance get the prescription drugs
      they need, under Part D of the program (or Part C if you are
      enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Plan). Everyone with Medicare
      can join a drug plan to get this coverage. Not all Medicare drug
      plans are the same, however. If you aren’t sure whether a drug
      plan is approved by Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (6334227). Look
      for the “Medicare Approved” seal on drug discount cards to make
      sure you are getting the best deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicare prescription drug coverage pays expenses up to $2,800;
      once your prescription costs exceeds that amount, you will no
      longer have coverage and will be responsible for the full cost of
      your drugs. However, once your out-of-pocket spending reaches
      $4,550, your prescription coverage will kick back in. Any amount
      of prescription drug spending between $2,800 and $4,550 is called
      the coverage gap or “Medicare donut hole.” Beginning in 2013, if
      you reach the coverage gap, you will automatically get a 52.5%
      discount on covered brand-name drugs and a 14% discount on generic
      drugs. If you have limited income and resources, you may get extra
      help to cover prescription drugs for little or no cost. For more
      information, contact the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
      Services (p. 100).

      Many people assume their spouses or children will automatically be
      allowed to make financial and/or medical decisions for them, but
      this is not necessarily true.

      Advance directives are written documents that tell your doctors
      what kind of treatment you want if you become unable to make
      medical decisions (for example, if you’re in a coma). Forms and
      laws vary from state to state, so it’s a good idea to understand
      the laws of the state where you live when you write advance
      directives. It’s also a good idea to make them before you are very
      ill. Federal law requires hospitals, nursing homes, and other
      institutions that receive Medicare or Medicaid funds to provide
      written information regarding advance medical directives to all
      patients upon admission.

      A living will is one type of advance directive that goes into
      effect when a person is terminally ill. A living will does not
      give you the opportunity to select someone to make decisions for
      you, but it does allow you to specify the kind of treatment you
      want in specific situations. For example, you might choose to
      specify that you do not want to be treated with antibiotics if
      death is imminent. You can, if you choose, include an advance
      directive that you do not wish to be resuscitated if your heart
      stops or if you stop breathing. In this case, a Do Not Resuscitate
      (DNR) order would be entered on your medical chart.

    <p>
      A durable power of attorney for health care (sometimes called a
      durable medical power of attorney) specifies the person you’ve
      chosen to make medical decisions for you. It is activated when
      you’re unconscious or unable to make medical decisions, or when
      you have specified. You need to choose someone who meets the legal
      requirements in your state for acting as your agent. State laws
      vary, but most states disqualify anyone under the age of 18, your
      health care provider, or employees of your health care provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person you choose as your agent must:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Be willing to speak and advocate on your behalf
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be willing to deal with conflict among friends and family
          members, if it arises
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Know you well and understand your wishes
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be willing to talk with you about these issues
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be someone you trust with your life
