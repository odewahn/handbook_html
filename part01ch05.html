      The U.S. Department of Education’s website,
      <a href="http://www.studentaid.ed.gov">www.studentaid.ed.gov</a>, provides information on
      preparing for and funding education beyond high school
      with details on the federal aid programs. Another source
      of information on financial assistance is <a href="http://www.finaid.org">www.finaid.org</a>.
      Both sites offer calculators to help you determine how
      much school will cost, how much you need to save, and
      how much aid you will need.

      Before selecting a college, you must understand the
      earning potential of your chosen career. You need to
      make sure that your annual salary after you graduate
      will be high enough to cover any student loan payments
      you may need to make in addition to your other living
      expenses. The Department of Labor has a web-based
      career search tool that will give you information
      concerning the average annual salary for various career
      options at

      <p>
        Many state governments have created 529 plans that
        make it easier for families to save for their child’s
        education. These plans, which can be sponsored by
        states or institutions of higher learning, encourage saving
        for future college costs, and the earnings grow tax-free.
        There are two main types: “pre-paid tuition plans” and
        “college savings plans.” Pre-paid plans allow you to pay
        for your child’s college tuition based on today’s costs,
        and then pay out at the future (higher) cost once your
        child is in college. College savings plans allow you to
        invest money in several investment funds, ranging in risk
        level, to pay for your child’s college education. For more
        information about the different types of 529 plans and
        the plans available in each state, visit

      <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35836376"><h5>Beware: Scholarship and Financial Aid Scams</h5>
        
        <p>
          Scholarships and financial aid do not require up-front
          fees. While there are legitimate companies that will
          help guide you through the financial aid and college
          application process for a fee, disreputable companies
          may ask you for money up front and provide nothing in
          return. Red flags to watch out for include the following:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              A “money-back guarantee” to secure a scholarship.
              Don’t believe it. Unscrupulous companies attach
              conditions that make it impossible to get the refund.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              “Secret scholarships.” If a company claims to have
              inside knowledge of scholarship money, it’s lying.
              Information on scholarships is freely available to the
              public. Ask your librarian or school counselor.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Telling students they’ve been selected as “finalists”
              for awards.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Asking for a student’s checking account to “confirm
              eligibility.” If a company wants bank account
              information or your credit card number to confirm or
              reserve a scholarship, it’s a scam.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Quoting a relatively small “monthly” or “weekly” fee,
              then asking for authorization to debit your checking
              account for an unspecified length of time. Ongoing
              fees are a sure sign of a scam.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Unsolicited offers. Whether it’s an e-mail or phone call,
              or it arrives in your mailbox, if you didn’t request the
              information, ignore the offer.

    <p>
      Student financial aid is available from a variety of sources,
      including the federal government, individual states, colleges and
      universities, and other public and private agencies and
      organizations. The four basic types of college aid are:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Grants.</strong>Gift aid that does
          not have to be repaid and is generally awarded according to
          financial need.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Work-Study.</strong> The Federal
          Work-Study Program (FWS) is a federally funded source of
          financial assistance used to offset financial education costs.
          Students who qualify earn money by working while attending
          school. This money does not have to be repaid.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Loans.</strong> Funds are borrowed
          and must be repaid with interest. As a general rule, federal
          student loans have more favorable terms and lower interest
          rates than traditional consumer loans do.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Scholarships.</strong> Funds are
          offered by the school, local/ community organizations, private
          institutions, and trusts. Scholarships do not have to be
          repaid and are generally awarded based on specific criteria.

      <section data-type="sect2" id="id35836736"><h2>Defaulting on Student Loans</h2>
        
      <p>
        You can take steps to avoid defaulting on your student
        loan. Before you get the loan, determine how much
        money you need to borrow and only borrow that amount.
        When you get the loan, make certain that you understand
        the details such as the payment terms and what type of
        loan you have. Once your student loan becomes due:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
        <p>
        Maintain accurate records of your loan, including the
        loan agreement, interest rates, and account numbers.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Track your loans to stay updated on how much you
        owe.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Make certain that the loan servicer has your current
        contact information and bank account (if payments are
        withdrawn automatically).
        </p>
        </li></ul>
        <p>
        If you default, it means you failed to make payments on
        your student loan as scheduled. Your loan becomes
        delinquent the first day after you miss a payment.
        However, the loan isn’t in default until 270 days have
        passed without a payment. The consequences of default
        can be severe, including:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
        <p>
        The entire unpaid balance of your loan and any interest
        is immediately due and payable.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Your loan account is assigned to a collection agency.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        The loan will be reported as delinquent to credit
        bureaus, damaging your credit.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Your federal and state taxes may be withheld through
        a tax offset. This means that the Internal Revenue 
        Service can take your federal and state tax refund to
        collect any of your defaulted student loan debt.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Your employer can withhold money from your pay and
          send the money to the government. This process is
          called wage garnishment.
        </p>
        </li></ul>
        <p>
          If you are having difficulty making your payments, contact
          your loan servicer immediately. The servicer may be
          able to help by changing your repayment plan, switching
          the due date, getting a deferment or forbearance, or
          consolidating your student loans.
        </p>
        <p>
          For information about these consequences and how to
          avoid defaulting, visit <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/default">studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/default</a>.
