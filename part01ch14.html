      Choices for phone service, Internet, and television have never
      been greater. As devices have multiple functions, such as the
      ability to watch television shows on your computer or surf the
      Internet using your phone, your decisions about each of these
      services may overlap. Most consumers are now able to bundle phone,
      TV, and Internet service for a discount; however, buying a bundle
      of services could make it more difficult to change providers for
      any one service if you’re tied into a long-term contract. Before
      you buy, compare services and prices and think about what you
      really need.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35842154"><h2>Choosing Service Providers</h2>
      
    <p>
      To connect your computer to the Internet, you’ll need an Internet
      Service Provider (ISP). Some ISPs are large and well known, while
      others are literally one-person operations. Some companies limit
      their service to providing Internet access only. Others, such as a
      telephone or cable company, may offer Internet access as part of a
      larger package of services. It is important to compare service
      providers and options to make sure you are getting what you want
      as well as the best deal possible to meet your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have limited Internet expertise, you may want to start with
      one of the well-known ISPs. They usually offer user-friendly
      startup software that often includes features such as a browser,
      instant messaging, parental controls, and pop-up blockers. Many
      also offer 24-hour tech support. However, this convenience results
      in higher monthly user fees. Once you are comfortable with how the
      Internet works, you may decide you don’t need the “extras” and can
      switch to a lower-cost ISP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider these factors when selecting a provider:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Speed</strong>. If you only want to
      check e-mail and read web pages, a dial-up connection may be
      enough. But if you want to download music or television shows or
      watch videos, you will need a faster connection with broadband
      access, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modem, or
      satellite.
    </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Availability</strong>. Which
          companies offer service in your area?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Wireless access</strong>. Can you
          get a wireless connection for other computers in your home?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>E-mail</strong>. Do e-mail accounts
          come with the service? What will be the storage limit on your
          mailbox?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Software</strong>. Is any software
          required to activate the service?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Support</strong>. What kinds of
          support are available—phone, e-mail, chat, etc.? Is the
          support free?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Special features</strong>. What
          services are provided for spam blocking, virus protection,
          instant messaging, and chat rooms?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Terms of service</strong>. Is there
          a limit to the amount of data you can use per month?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cost</strong>. What is the monthly
          fee for the service? Are there fees for renting a modem or set
          up?
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35842270"><h2>WiFi (Wireless)</h2>
      
    <p>
      Going wireless provides you with the freedom to use your computer
      in multiple locations, without dragging cables and cords with you.
      However, with the privilege of increased freedom comes the danger
      of increased vulnerability. Wireless Internet requires that you
      have access to a wireless network via a wireless router. It is
      important that you secure your network so strangers (or neighbors)
      can’t use your network without your knowledge (also known as
      “piggybacking”). Also, computer hackers could use your network to
      access personal information you save or send from your computer.
      This is particularly important if you conduct financial
      transactions online. If you use the wireless (Wi-Fi) network at
      bookstores, airports, or other public places, there are other
      precautions you should take to protect your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Turn on encryption.</strong> When
          you buy a wireless router, it is important to turn on the
          encryption feature. This scrambles information that you send
          over the Internet so other people cannot access it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Rename your router.</strong> Change
          the name from the default to something only you would know.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Change the password.</strong>
          Routers come with a standard password. Create a new one with a
          mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. For help
          creating passwords, see page 40.
        </p>

      <p>If you’ve ever received a “security alert” stating 
        that malicious software was found on your computer, it 
        may have been scareware. These messages will persuade 
        you that your computer is infected with a virus that 
        you can eliminate only by purchasing and installing specific 
        software. Don’t follow that advice; shut down your browser 
        without clicking on the message. If you believe your 
        computer is infected, you should run a scan using a known 
        anti-virus software. For more information about scareware

          <strong>Be aware of cookies.</strong>Cookies
          are small text files that some websites place on your computer
          to collect information about the pages you view and your

      On public wireless networks:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Don’t assume the network is
      secure.</strong> Most public wireless networks don’t encrypt
      information you send. Avoid sending private information from
      public locations.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Use encrypted websites.</strong>If you
      must send sensitive information from a public network, make
      certain that URL starts with “https” (“s” means secure). Look for
      that on every page you visit.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Log off</strong>sites after you finish
      using them rather than using “remember me” features. It is better
      to log in again than give away your login credentials to someone
      else on the network.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35842434"><h2>Online File Sharing</h2>
      
    <p>
      Every day, millions of computer users share files online. Whether
      music, games, video, or software, peer-topeer (P2P) file sharing
      allows users to share all kinds of content. To share files, you
      download special software that connects your computer to an
      informal network of other computers running the same software. The
      software is often free and easy to access.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, file sharing can have a number of risks. For example,
      when you are connected to file-sharing programs, you unknowingly
      could allow others to copy private files you never intended to
      share. You could download material that is protected by copyright
      laws and find yourself mired in legal issues; you could download a
      virus or facilitate a security breach; or you could unwittingly
      download pornography labeled as something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      To secure the personal information stored on your computer, the
      FTC suggests that you:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Set up the file-sharing software very carefully.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be aware of spyware and use a good anti-spyware program.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Close your connection when you’re not using it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use an effective anti-virus program and update it regularly.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Talk with your family about file sharing.
        </p>

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35842504"><h2>Online Copyright Issues</h2>
      
    <p>
      Quite simply, it’s illegal to make or download unauthorized copies
      of software or online media, such as books, music, and videos.
      Whether you are casually making a few copies for friends, lending
      disks, distributing and/or downloading pirated software via the
      Internet, or buying a single software program and then installing
      it on 100 computers, you are committing a copyright infringement.
      It doesn’t matter whether or not you make money doing it. If you
      or your company is caught copying software, you may be held liable
      under both civil and criminal law. If the copyright owner brings a
      civil action against you, the owner can seek to stop you from
      using its software immediately and can request monetary damages.
      The copyright owner can sue for as much as $150,000 for each
      program copied. In addition, the government can prosecute you
      criminally for copyright infringement. If convicted, you can be
      fined up to $250,000, sentenced to jail for up to five years, or
      both.

    <p>
      Today many consumers purchase music and e-books as digital
      downloads to play on digital music players or mobile devices.
      However, just because you buy the file, doesn’t mean you actually
      own the song. A media service provider sells you a license to
      listen to your downloaded music, but that license may restrict
      your ability to lend, share, transfer, or burn the contents of
      your music library. You may be able to use the songs on several
      devices; the rules vary from provider to provider. Before you
      download or click “I Agree,” know your rights under the terms of
      service agreement. For more information about digital copyright,
      contact the United States Patent and Trademark Office (p. 97).

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35842565"><h2>Preventing Online Fraud</h2>
      
    <p>
      The Internet gives you easy access to information, 
      entertainment, financial offers, and countless other 
      services. The flip side, however, is that it can leave
      you vulnerable to online scammers, identity thieves, and criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online frauds are not limited to fake companies. 
      Thieves will often try to disguise a fraudulent website 
      by giving the site a URL close to the URL of a
      legitimate, well-known site. Internet criminals try to trick
      customers of these legitimate sites into sharing their personal 
      information on fake sites, so they can use that
      information for identity theft or credit card fraud schemes. Some 
      scam artists have even used the IRS name and logo to collect 
      taxpayers’ personal information so they can
      steal taxpayers’ identity. Visit <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Suspicious-e-Mails-and-Identity-Theft">www.irs.gov/uac/Suspicious-e-Mails-and-Identity-Theft</a>
      to learn more about tax-related online fraud and how to 
      identify a fraudulent e-mail or website. To guard against 
      Internet fraud, follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Know your seller.</strong> If you
          don’t, do some research.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Company websites</strong> often
          provide information in a section called “About Us.” Some
          online sellers participate in programs, such as BBBOnLine,
          that help resolve problems. Look for a logo or endorsement
          seal on the company website; this indication, however, is not
          a guarantee of the seller’s reliability.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check with state</strong> and/or
          local consumer offices.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading comments from other
          consumers</strong> is another way to check the integrity of
          online sellers. Some Internet auction sites post ratings of
          sellers based on buyers’ comments. Beware of too many glowing
          stories the sellers themselves might have placed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Protect your personal
          information</strong>. Don’t provide it in response to an
          e-mail, a pop-up, or a website you’ve linked to from an e-mail
          or web page.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Take your time</strong> and resist
          any urge to “act now” to keep your account open or take
          advantage of a special offer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use anti-virus and anti-spyware
          software</strong>, as well as a firewall, and update them
          all regularly. Make sure your operating system and web browser
          are set up properly and update them regularly as well.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Protect your passwords</strong>.
          Don’t share your passwords with anyone. Memorize them.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t take the bait.</strong> Don’t
          reply to e-mail messages that claim your credit card
          information or other personal information needs to be updated.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Back up important files</strong>.
          Copy them onto another computer or a removable hard drive such
          as a flash memory stick.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Learn whom to contact if something goes wrong online. Report
      suspected fraud to your bank, credit card company, or relevant
      authority.

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35842705"><h5>Social Networking</h5>
      
    <p>
      Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
      Pinterest, and others continue to gain popularity. These sites
      make it easy to reconnect, stay in touch, and even do business.
      But recent reports involving privacy concerns and crimes should
      make users more careful about the information they share. Some
      tips to consider to protect your privacy and safety include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Make your contact information private.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Limit who can search your profile from Internet search
          engines.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Manage who can view your images; untag photos if necessary.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Create separate lists to manage who can see the information
          you’ve posted.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be careful about who can see your status updates.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Refrain from telling people where you are at any specific
          time.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be cautious about arranging meetings in person with online
          acquaintances.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that current or prospective employers may be able
          to see your social network pages and photos.

    <p>
      E-mail spam is not just unwanted; it can be offensive. Decrease
      the number of spam e-mails you receive by making it difficult for
      spammers to get and use your e-mail address:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Don’t use an obvious e-mail address, such as <em data-type="email">JaneDoe@isp.com</em>.
          Instead use numbers or other digits, such as <em data-type="email">Jane4oe6@isp.com</em>.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use one e-mail address for close friends and family and
          another for everyone else. Free addresses are available from
          Yahoo!, Gmail, and Hotmail. You can also get a disposable
          forwarding address from
          <a href="http://www.spammotel.com">www.spammotel.com</a>. If
          an address attracts too much spam, get rid of it and establish
          a new one.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t post your e-mail address on a public web page. Spammers
          use software that harvests text addresses. Substitute
          “jane4oe6 at isp.com” for “jane4oe6@isp. com,” or display your
          address as a graphic image, not text.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t enter your address on a website before you check its
          privacy policy.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Uncheck any checked boxes. These often grant the site or its
          partners permission to contact you.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t click on an e-mail’s “unsubscribe” link unless you trust
          the sender. This action tells the sender you are there.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Never forward chain letters, petitions, or virus warnings. All
          could be a spammer’s trick to collect addresses.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Disable your e-mail “preview pane.” This stops spam from
          reporting to its sender that you’ve received it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Choose an ISP that filters e-mail. If you get lots of spam,
          your ISP may not be filtering effectively.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use spam-blocking software. Web browser software often
          includes free filtering options. You can also purchase special
          software that will accomplish this task.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Report spam. Alert your ISP that spam is slipping through its
          filters. The FTC also wants to know about “unsolicited
          commercial e-mail.” Forward spam to <em data-type="email">spam@uce.gov</em>.

    <p>
      The choices for phone service have never been greater. Most
      consumers are now able to buy local and long-distance phone
      service from their telephone company, cable or satellite TV
      provider, or ISP. Services such as voice mail, call waiting,
      caller ID, and wireless may be offered as a package deal or sold
      separately. Before you buy, compare services and prices and think
      about what you really need:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Whom do you call most often?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What time of day or day of the week do you call?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you want to get messages? If so, do you need voice mail, or
          will an answering machine do?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you want call waiting and/or caller ID?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How important is it for you to have your phone with you
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      when you are away from home? Find out how each company prices its
      services. Are there minimum use, time-of-day, or distance
      requirements; flat monthly fees; or special plans? For example,
      wireless service may be cheaper than regular local service if you
      don’t make many calls. Make sure you’re comparing prices on
      similar plans and features. Understand that many service providers
      offer contracts for specific periods. Read the fine print and ask
      questions if there is anything you’re not clear about.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35843102"><h5>Bundling, Promotions, And Deals</h5>
      
    <p>
      Do you want to get Internet, telephone, and TV service from the
      same provider? Buying a bundle of services from one provider can
      be a good deal, but it can also make it more difficult to change
      providers for any one service if you’re tied into a long-term
      contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Special promotions such as introductory pricing may be enticing,
      but read the fine print. The promotion price probably does not
      include taxes or the cost of extra equipment or fees. Ask the
      provider to explain all the one-time, recurring, and special
      charges, including taxes and fees. Get all promises in writing.
      Ask when the special promotions end and what the post-promotion
      cost will be. Also find out whether you have to install any
      special equipment and whether the provider will help troubleshoot
      on the phone if you have any problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some deals are available only online or by phone. Even if you have
      to order online, call the provider first to ask questions. When
      you are online, review any frequently asked questions, minimum
      system requirements, and fine-print terms and conditions. Read the
      entire customer service agreement and print a copy for your
      records. For more information, visit

    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35843146"><h5>Beware: Caller ID Spoofing</h5>
      
      <p>
        Scammers have adopted the practice of Caller ID spoofing to 
        obtain personal information from consumers. In this fraud, 
        someone calls you using a false name and phone number for 
        the Caller ID screen. During the call, the scammer describes 
        an urgent scenario, such as the cancellation of an account. 
        The caller may say you can avoid the cancellation if you 
        provide your bank account or credit card number to pay the 
        company. If you give the sensitive information, the caller 
        can use it to steal your identity or use your bank accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can prevent being a victim of caller ID spoofing. 
        Don’t give out personal information on an incoming call. 
        Hang up and call the customer service phone number printed 
        on your statement, on the company’s website, or in the 
        phonebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Report caller ID spoofers to the Federal Communications 
        Commission at <a href="http://fcc.gov/complaints">fcc.gov/complaints</a> or 1-888-225-5322.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35843197"><h2>Slamming and Cramming</h2>
      
    <p>
      “Slamming” occurs when a phone company illegally switches your
      phone service without your permission. If you notice a different
      company name on your bill or see phone charges that are higher
      than normal, contact the company that slammed you and ask to be
      switched back to your original company. Tell the company you are
      exercising your right to refuse to pay charges, then report the
      problem to your original company and ask to be re-enrolled in your
      previous calling plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cramming” occurs when companies add charges to your phone bill
      without your permission. These charges may be for services such as
      voice mail, ringtones, or subscriptions. You may not notice these
      monthly charges because they are relatively small, $5 to $30, and
      look like your regular phone charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Take These Steps to Avoid Slammers and Crammers:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Block changes to your phone service.</strong> Ask your telephone
          service provider if it offers a blocking or account protection
          service, which usually requires the company to notify you
          before making any changes to your service.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Read the fine print</strong> on
          contest entry forms and coupons. You could be agreeing to
          switch your phone service or to buy optional services.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Watch out for impostors.</strong>
          Companies could falsely claim to be your regular phone company
          and offer some type of discount plan or change in billing.
          They may also say they are taking a survey or they may pretend
          to be a government agency.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Beware of “negative option
          notices.”</strong> You can be switched or signed up for
          optional services unless you say “NO” to telemarketers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Examine your telephone bill</strong>
          carefully, including pages that show the details, and look for
          suspicious charges.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Your phone service cannot be shut off for refusal to pay for
      unauthorized services. For help, contact your local or state
      consumer protection agency (p. 112), state public utilities
      commission (p. 138), or the FCC (p. 106).

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35843290"><h2>Cell Phones</h2>
      
    <p>
      Before you sign a contract and choose a plan and a company that
      meets your needs, you should ask these types of questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Where can you make and receive
      calls?</strong> Most providers now offer a choice of local,
      regional, or national plans. A local plan offers low-cost options
      if most of your calls are near your home. Regional plans cover a
      larger geographic area—sometimes several states. If you call
      outside the area covered by these plans, you will pay
      long-distance and roaming charges in addition to the airtime used.
      National plans are the most expensive, but they let you use your
      phone anywhere in the country for a single per-minute price.
    </p>
    <figure float="0"><figcaption/><div class="border-box"><img src="images/pdf5131_img_28.png"/></div></figure>
    <p>
      <strong>How frequently will you use the
      phone?</strong> If you just want a phone for emergencies, an
      economy plan with a few minutes a month may be all you need. On
      the other hand, if your cell phone is your primary phone, a plan
      with the lowest airtime rate is a wiser choice. If you plan to use
      texting, pick a plan that will meet your needs and avoid surprises
      on your bills. Most services allow you to upgrade a plan without
      an added one-time charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Is a family plan option
      available?</strong>You can share one cellular service plan and a
      pool of monthly usage minutes among several phone lines. The cost
      of the additional numbers per month is usually less than if you
      purchased individual accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Is there a trial
      period?</strong> There are “dead spots” where a cell phone doesn’t 
      work. A trial period lets you test your service and try the features 
      of the phone without incurring a termination fee.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Know your options.</strong>
      Make sure you are only buying the options or features you really need. 
      It is always easier to upgrade a plan later if you feel you need another 
      feature.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>What if you want to cancel your
      service?</strong> Most providers have a penalty. This is a concern if you have
      to move out of the area covered by your plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to keep track of your usage and understand your 
        cell phone bill to avoid “bill shock.” Visit

      Retailers can use your phone’s GPS for geofencing— sending you
      coupons and promotions when you are near their stores so you’ll
      buy the items there instead of buying the same item online for a
      possibly cheaper price. If you have signed up to receive text

      <section data-type="sect2" id="id35843390"><h2>Smart Phones</h2>
        
    <p>
      Smart phones are like miniature computers; they provide basic
      phone functions, along with advanced features, including browsing
      the Internet, accessing e-mail, interacting on online social
      networks, listening to music, watching videos, uploading pictures,
      and using apps. They also allow use of a QWERTY keyboard to make
      texting and e-mailing easy. (The keys are arranged the same way
      they are on a computer keyboard.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When shopping for a smart phone, consider these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Consider the shape and size of the phone.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure you can use the keypad easily to make calls and send
          messages.
        </p>
      </li><li>
          <p>
            Do you need to access the Internet with your phone? If so, a
            data plan is required. Find out how much it costs; compare
            options carefully. Data plans govern use and costs associated
            with mobile access for e-mail, text messaging, web browsing,
            social networking, and other applications.
          </p>

            Is there a limit on the amount of data you can use each month?
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Be wary of buying phone insurance, which may sound tempting;

    <p>
      Paying for your purchases using a smart phone app has become more
      common and convenient. In a sense you have a digital wallet that
      contains your credit card numbers, store loyalty cards, and even
      digital coupons. When you get to the checkout counter, you pay by 
      swiping your phone at the checkout. You can also use it online. Before you

    <p>
      “Apps,” short for applications, are tools that help you accomplish
      tasks or find information when you are on the go. Apps are
      designed to work on smart phones and may be downloaded or accessed
      using your phone’s web browser. Some apps are designed for
      specific platforms (Android, Blackberry, or iPhone), so be sure to
      purchase apps that are compatible with your phone’s software
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some apps are free, many of them do charge a small fee.
      Before you click “download,” keep in mind that the cost of your
      purchases is deducted automatically from your bank account or
      charged to your credit card or phone bill. Keep track of the
      amount of money you spent on apps to avoid shock when you receive
      your bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visit <a href="http:Apps.usa.gov">Apps.usa.gov</a> to

    <p>
      If you want cell phone service only for emergencies, or you aren’t
      sure how much you will actually use a cell phone once you get it,
      you may want to consider a prepaid cell phone before you commit to
      a long-term wireless contract. With a prepaid cell phone, there is
      no contract to sign and no monthly bill. You will know exactly how
      much you spend. The downside of prepaid plans is that you pay more
      per minute, and, if you don’t use the phone for an extended
      period, you may lose the money in your account.

    <p>
      You can start with a basic lineup of channels and go from there.
      The more channels you want, the more it will cost. You may want to
      consider video on demand so you can order movies and sports events
      and watch them when you like (usually within a 24-hour window).
      You can also buy a bundle of services that includes digital TV,
      digital phone, and broadband Internet access at discounted rates.
      Bear in mind, however, that you may be asked to sign a contract
      for bundled services.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35843628"><h2>Satellite</h2>
    
    <p>
      This requires a dish that’s mounted outside (service requires an
      unobstructed view of the satellite) and a receiver that’s placed
      by your television. Satellite TV offers comparable channels to
      cable TV, and you can add a digital video recorder to record shows
      for viewing later. One downside to satellite TV is occasional
      interference during periods of rain or snow. Check with your
      satellite TV provider for channel options and prices. As with
      cable TV, you may be asked to sign a contract for a package of
      services.

    <p>
      If you have a high-speed Internet connection, you’re already able
      to watch thousands of videos on your computer. Movies and TV shows
      are also available and becoming more prevalent as large online
      companies start distributing TV programming. You may even be able
      to connect your computer to your television so that shows you
      would normally watch online can project on a larger screen.
      Several services allow Internet streaming for a fee, along with
      free access to shows on network websites.
