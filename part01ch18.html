    <p>
      It’s unfortunate how many people believe that estate planning is
      only for the wealthy. People at all economic levels benefit from
      an estate plan. Upon death, an estate plan legally protects and
      distributes property based on your wishes and the needs of your
      family and/or survivors with the fewest tax consequences.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35844804"><h1>Wills</h1>
      
    <p>
      A will is the most practical first step in estate planning. It
      makes clear how you want your property to be distributed after you
      die. Writing a will can be as simple as typing out how you want
      your assets to be transferred to loved ones or charitable
      organizations after your death. If you don’t have a will when you
      die, your estate will be handled in probate, and your property
      could be distributed differently from what you would like.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may help to get legal advice when writing a will, particularly
      when it comes to understanding all of the rules of the estate
      disposition process in your state. For information about legal
      issues, see page 58. Some states, for instance, have
      community-property laws that entitle your surviving spouse to keep
      half of your wealth after you die, no matter what percentage you
      leave him or her. Fees for the execution of a will vary according
      to its complexity.
    </p>

    <section data-type="sect1" id="id35844831"><h1>Choose an Executor</h1>
      
    <p>
      An executor is the person who is responsible for settling the
      estate after death. Duties of an executor include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Taking inventory of property and belongings
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Appraising and distributing assets
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Paying taxes
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Settling debts owed by the deceased
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Most important, the
      executor is legally obligated to act in the interests of the
      deceased, following the wishes provided by the will. Here
      again, it can be helpful to consult an attorney to help with
      the probate process or offer legal guidance. In most states,
      any person over the age of 18 who hasn’t been convicted of a
      felony can be named executor of a will. Some people choose a
      lawyer, accountant, or financial consultant based on his or
      her professional experience. Others choose a spouse, adult
      child, relative, or friend. Since the role of executor can be 
      demanding, it’s often a good idea to ask the person if he or she
      is willing to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve been named executor in someone’s
      will but are not able or do not want to serve, you need to file a
      “declination,” which is a legal document that declines your
      designation as an executor. The contingent executor named in the
      will then assumes responsibility. If no contingent executor is
      named, the court will appoint one.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35844879"><h5>Rules To Remember When Writing A Will</h5>
      
<ul><li>
    <p>
      In most states, you must be 18 years of age or older.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      To be valid, a will must be written when you are of sound judgment 
      and have adequate mental capacity.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      The document must clearly state that it is your will.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      An executor of your will, who ensures your estate is 
      distributed according to your wishes, must be named.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to notarize or record your will, 
      but doing so can safeguard any claims that it is invalid. 
      To be valid, you must sign a will in the presence of at 
      least two witnesses.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      A financial will and testament will always supersede a 
      last will and testament when bestowing financial assets.

      <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35844927"><h5>Write A Social Media Will</h5>
        
        <p>
          Social media are a part of daily life, so what happens 
          to the online content you created once you die? If you 
          are active online, you should consider creating a social 
          media will, or statement of how you would like your online 
          identity to be handled. You should appoint someone you 
          trust as an online executor. This person will be responsible 
          for closing your email addresses, social media profiles, 
          and blogs after you are deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take these steps to help you write a social media will:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              Review the privacy policies and the terms and conditions 
              of each website where you have a presence.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              State how you would like your profiles to be handled. 
              You may want to cancel your profile completely or keep 
              it up for friends and family to visit. Some sites allow 
              users to create a memorial profile where other users can 
              still see your profile but can’t post anything new.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Give the responsible person a document that lists all 
              of the websites where you have a profile, along with 
              your usernames and passwords.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Stipulate in your will that the online executor should 
              have a copy of your death certificate. The online executor 
              may need this as proof for websites to take any actions on 
              your behalf.

  <section data-type="sect1" id="id35844982"><h1>Funerals</h1>
    
    <p>
      One of the most expensive purchases many consumers will ever make
      is arranging for a funeral. A traditional burial, including a
      casket and vault, costs about $7,000. Extras such as flowers,
      obituary notices, cards, and limousines can add thousands of
      dollars more. At such a highly emotional time, many people are
      easily swayed to believe that their decisions reflect how they
      feel about the deceased and wind up spending more than may be
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most funeral providers are professionals who work to serve their
      clients’ needs and best interests. Unfortunately, some do not.
      They may take advantage of clients by insisting on unnecessary
      services and overcharging consumers. That’s why there is a federal
      law, called the Funeral Rule that regulates the actions of funeral
      directors, homes, and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many funeral providers offer a variety of package plans that
      include products and services that are most commonly sold. Keep in
      mind, you are not obligated to buy a package plan; you have the
      right to buy the individual products and services you prefer. As
      outlined by the Funeral Rule:
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar" id="id35845013"><h5>The Funeral Rule</h5>
      
    <p>
      A federal law makes it easier for you to choose only the goods and
      services you want or need when planning a funeral, and to pay only
      for those you select. The Funeral Rule, enforced by the FTC,
      requires funeral directors to give you itemized prices in person
      and, if you ask, over the phone.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          You have the right to choose the funeral goods and services
          you want (with some exceptions).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The funeral provider must state this “Rule” in writing on the
          general price list.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If state or local law requires you to buy any particular item,
          the funeral provider must disclose it on the price list, with
          a reference to the specific law.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The funeral provider may not refuse, or charge a fee, to
          handle a casket that you bought elsewhere.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A funeral provider who offers cremations must make alternative
          containers available.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          When prepaying for funeral services, do not agree to give the
          check from the life insurance company directly to the funeral
          home. You are paying for specific goods and services, and
          signing over the life insurance check might result in a
          significant overpayment for services rendered.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <p>
      Planning ahead is the best way to make informed decisions about funeral 
      arrangements. An advance plan also spares your family from having to 
      make choices in the middle of grief and under time constraints. 
      Every family is different, and funeral arrangements are influenced by 
      religious and cultural traditions, budgets, and personal preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not legally required to use a funeral home to plan and conduct 
      a funeral, but most people find that the services of a professional 
      funeral home make the process easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparison shopping, either in person or by phone, can save you
      money and is much easier when done in advance. Visit
      <a href="http://www.funerals.org">www.funerals.org</a> to learn
      more about how to select a funeral home and research its history.
      Many funeral homes will also send you a price list by mail, but
      this is not required by law. If you have a problem concerning
      funeral matters, it’s best to try to resolve it first with the
      funeral director. If you are dissatisfied, the Funeral Consumers
      Alliance (p. 110) may be able to advise you on how best to resolve
      your issue. You can also contact your state or local consumer
      protection agencies (p. 112) or the Funeral Service Consumer
      Assistance Program at 1-800-662-7666. Most states have a licensing
      board that regulates the funeral industry. You can contact the
      board in your state for information or help.

    <section data-type="sect2" id="id35845100"><h2>Prepaying</h2>
      
    <p>
      Millions of Americans have entered into contracts to prearrange
      their funerals and prepay some or all of the expenses involved.
      Various states have laws to help ensure that these advance
      payments are available to pay for the funeral products and
      services when they’re needed; however, protections vary widely
      from state to state. Some state laws require the funeral home or
      cemetery to place a percentage of the prepayment in a
      state-regulated trust or to purchase a life insurance policy with
      the death benefits assigned to the funeral home or cemetery. For a
      list of questions to consider before prepaying for a funeral,
